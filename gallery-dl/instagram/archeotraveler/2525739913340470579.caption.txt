This dramatic landscape hidden on the Isle of Skye looks as though you've stepped into the magical realm⁣
The Fairy Glen is one of the Isle of Skye’s most enchanting attractions. The bumpy, off-the-beaten-path spot stands out from the surrounding farmland. The natural rock formations, cone-shaped hills dotted with ponds and scattered waterfalls, are all within one small area, making it seem as though it’s the shrunken version of a large-scale geological wonder.⁣
Though there’s no definitive folklore linking the land to the magical realm, some say faeries created the dramatic landscape and still dwell within its many crevices.
