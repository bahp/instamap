Tsurunoyu Onsen in Akita Prefecture is one of Japan's most famous onsen, particularly popular for its snow-viewing onsens🧖‍♀️As it's known as a "hidden onsen," we drove along snowy roads for quite a while before finally arriving at the ryokan. Being a highly sought-after ryokan, securing a reservation can be quite challenging. I was granted permission to take photos of the onsen on the condition that no one else was present, but there were only a few minutes when the area was completely empty.😅
秋田県の鶴の湯温泉♨️日本で有名な温泉の一つで、特に雪見温泉が人気です。秘湯と呼ばれるだけあり
、雪道をひたすら車ですすみ、旅館に到着しました。人気の旅館なので予約は大変です。温泉は、人がいないことを条件に撮影許可をいただきましたが、人がいない時間はほんの数分でした。
