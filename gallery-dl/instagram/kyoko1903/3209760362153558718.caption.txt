Kyoto Autumn Guide Part 1
京都紅葉ガイド Part1

The best time to see the autumn leaves in Kyoto is usually from mid to late November🍁Today, I'd like to show yox some autumn spots located a little far from the Higashiyama area, the center of Kyoto sightseeing.
京都の紅葉の見頃は、例年11月中旬〜下旬です。今回は、京都観光の中心地、東山地区から少し離れた場所の紅葉をご紹介🍂

1. Ryuonji temple / #龍穏寺
The tunnel of autumn leaves before entering the temple is just amazing.
特に境内に入る前の紅葉のトンネルが素晴らしくきれいです。

2-4. Arashiyama / #嵐山
One of the famous sightseeing spots in Kyoto. Boat tour is also popular.
京都の有名な観光地の一つ。舟下りも人気です。

5-6. Sagano / #嵯峨野
The area is a 20-30 minute walk from Arashiyama. It is fun to walk around the many different shops and restaurants.
嵐山から20-30分歩くと着くエリア。色んなお店が立ち並んでいるので、歩いて回るのも楽しいです。

7-8. Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple / #愛宕念仏寺
The temple is a 5-minute walk from Sagano above. The temple are lined with as many as 1,200 stone arhats.
嵯峨野から歩いて5分ほどの場所にあるお寺。境内には1200体もの石の羅漢さんが並んでいます。

9. Jingoji Temple / #神護寺
A long stone staircase leads to the temple. This temple is large, so it is recommended that you wear comfortable shoes🐾 As it is located halfway up the mountain, the best time to see the autumn leaves is from early to mid-November, which is a little earlier than other places.
長い石段を歩いていくと辿り着くお寺。境内も広いので、疲れにくい靴で行くのがオススメです。山の中腹にあるため、紅葉の時期は11月上旬〜中旬が見頃と他の場所より少し早め。

10. Iwato Ochiba Shrine / #岩戸落葉神社
The large ginkgo tree and the yellow carpet created by the ginkgo are beautiful. The shrine itself is small.
大きなイチョウの木と、イチョウが作り出す黄色い絨毯がとで美しい。神社自体は小さいです。
