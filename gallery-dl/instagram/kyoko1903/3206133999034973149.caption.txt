During the autumn foliage season, Kyoto can get incredibly crowded, but the beauty is truly exceptional😭I heard that this year, due to the excessively hot summer, there are many leaves falling before they can change color. I wonder how it will actually turn out.
紅葉の時期の京都は、混雑もすごいけど、やっぱり美しさが格別✨今年は夏が暑すぎて、紅葉になる前に落ちてる葉っぱが多いと聞くけど、実際はどうなるかな🤔
