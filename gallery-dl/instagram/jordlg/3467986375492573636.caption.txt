Save this for your next trip to the Faroe Islands 📌

The Faroe Islands, a small cluster of islands in the North Atlantic, offer stunning, unique scenery. The best part? It’s so accessible! The longest drive we had was 45 minutes. Everything is well-connected by roads, bridges, and tunnels.

We visited all the spots in this video (and more) in just a week. Here are my top favorites:

MÝLINGUR – One of the most impressive cliffs I’ve seen. Since there’s no official trail it’s a bit tricky to reach, but as a result, we had the place to ourselves!

KLAKKUR – A perfect panoramic sunset viewpoint. If you’re lucky, you might find yourself standing above the clouds.

TINDHÓLMUR – This island, known as the “sleeping dragon” for its shape, offers stunning perspectives. To get up close, you’ll need to join a paid tour.

KALSOY – A long, thin island full of mystery and almost deserted. The only way there is by ferry, and the views from the northern tip are unforgettable!

BØUR – Our first taste of Faroese life. This charming fishing village features grass-roofed houses, friendly dogs, and stunning views of Drangarnir and Tindhólmur.

ÁSMUNDARSTAKKUR – Located on the southern island of Suðuroy, this spot has breathtaking sea stacks and cliffs. Don’t look down!
