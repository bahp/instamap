WHAT WE ATE IN TOKYO // Part 1! The #1 thing I was most excited. The thing I was most excited for in visiting Japan, was eating all of the delicious food I put in a lot of time and effort researching the best places to go, and here are some of my absolute favorite places that we visited on our 10 day trip to Japan.

1. Tsujihan ZEITAKU DON つじ半 日本橋本店: (no reservations, walk in only). This place has been all over my Instagram and TikTok so I had to give it a go. We got there at 10:15 on a Sunday and were the first people that were let in when it opened at 11 AM. Fish was super fresh and delicious and was very affordable Absolutely worth visiting if you’re OK with lining up

2. Oreryu Shio-Ramen: (no reservations, walk in only). No line when we went at 3pm on a weekday, but when we walked by another day around dinner time, there was a long line. Absolutely delicious Rahman, I think if I went back, I would order something a little bit lighter. 

3. Sushi Panchi 鮓ぱんち: (reservations required). Available for lunch or dinner Omakase. Would highly recommend, delicious fresh sushi!
