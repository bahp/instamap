POV you plan a Europe trip with your type-2-fun friend (me) who promises you that there’s so much more than just the big cities to see across the continent of Europe, so they (me 🙋🏼‍♀️) take you to one of these spots for some out-of-this-world hiking. Which trail would you pick? 🥾🌊🏰🏔️🍝 

I’m sure I’m missing several places on this list and will make a part 2 with places that got left off. We just made plans for a few days in Slovenia later this year. 🥲🇸🇮🏔️

PS you can join us in the Dolomites Aug 31-Sept 7 for the hike in this post + 2 hikes on the Alta Via 1 + a night in a rifugio + wine tasting + delicious food + via ferrata + cute mountain towns, all starting in Venice. 🇮🇹
