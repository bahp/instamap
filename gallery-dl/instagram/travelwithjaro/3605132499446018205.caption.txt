SAVE FOR LATER. How to find it!! 🥹👇🏽

Maybe you’ve been seeing this cafe around on Instagram, maybe not, but this has to be one of the most incredible cafe views i’ve ever seen in my life, and i’ve been traveling the world for the last 5 years, so it says a lot 😂

After making it to Bali, and driving just a few hours up to the North of Bali, my girlfriend and I were just looking for a place to escape and immerse in nature, and then..

WHAT.

We came across this cafe at Sekumpul Waterfall, and let’s just say that this was the best $2 i’ve ever spent on a Cappuccino 😭☕️

We ended up staying at Sekumpul Accommodation and it was like $20/night, so we ended up staying for a few days since the prices were so good, and the views were INSANE.

Grateful for this time I got to spend with my girlfriend, and definitely recommend you SAVE this for later! Absolute gem 🥰💎
