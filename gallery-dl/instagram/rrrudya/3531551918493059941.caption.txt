The Most Beautiful Village in the Alps 🏔✨

Nestled in the Valais region of the Swiss Alps, this hidden gem isn’t as famous as Zermatt or St. Moritz, but it has a unique charm that’s hard to beat. 🚠 With no cars allowed, this village is only accessible by cable car, making it a true alpine escape.

Skiers can glide straight from the slopes through the village’s main street, right to their cozy lodgings or one of the few restaurants serving delicious local dishes. 🎿🍴
