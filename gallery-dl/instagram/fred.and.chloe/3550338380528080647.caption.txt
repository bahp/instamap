Located just an hour (by train) from Tokyo, Kamakura is a great place for a day trip in Japan! 🇯🇵 

We took the earliest train from Tokyo and arrived just in time at Kamakurakōkō-Mae Station for sunrise! The view was stunning and it was much less crowded at that hour!

We highly recommend visiting this cafe afterwards, where you can enjoy traditional Japanese breakfast right beside the Enoden track! 🚃 

We ordered the Mackerel fish set (2170 yen) and had fun whipping up the egg white (with some help from the friendly staff 🤣)! Also tried the Shirasu Don (1780 yen), with tons of tiny whitebait fish covering the rice - a specialty of Kamakura!

P.s. There are only 6-7 seats by the rail track, so do reserve your slot online to avoid long waiting time!
