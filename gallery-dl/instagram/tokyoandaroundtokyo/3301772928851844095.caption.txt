Be the lord of the castle 🏯, or at least pretend to be! You may very well have Arato Castle, atop a hillside overlooking Chikuma City in Nagano, all to yourself. The trek up the hillside to the castle will give you an idea what it might have felt like for attackers to make an attack (minus the heavy armor), as the castle was involved in many battles featuring legendary warlord Takeda Shingen. The structure of the castle, built before the massive stone castles that would come at the latter part of the 16th century, may seem light, but the builders made strategic use of the natural landscape to create defenses that helped Arato Castle withstand several attacks before it was ultimately destroyed ⚔️. Now, many structures have been rebuilt based on their original construction, so come and admire a different era of Japanese castle with a spectacular view of Nagano!
