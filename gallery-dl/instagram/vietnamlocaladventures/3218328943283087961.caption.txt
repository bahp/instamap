Mu Cang Chai one of the most beautiful rice terraces in Vietnam! Itâ€™s a stunning place for those who want to photograph local life & rice fields! The best time to visit here from September to early October. There is one season called seedling season for professional photographers to take pictures of the ethnic people cultivating on the farm with buffaloes around later June- early July.
