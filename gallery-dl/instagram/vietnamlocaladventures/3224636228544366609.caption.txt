Trang An, also call “Halong bay on the land” - is one of the most worthy places to visit in Ninh Binh – Believe Me.

Trang An has three routes in total. All are amazing, you can see the beautiful scenery, virtual living between natures. 
We are recommending you guys route 3 which is including a 1 km long cave, two temples, and the movie takes place in King Kong village.
If you need any help, please let’s us know on PM!
