Crete > Mallorca. There, we said it (but you can keep going to Mallorca so we can have Crete all to ourselves)
No crowds, perfect roads, wild landscapes, amazing food and that feeling like you found something no one else knows about (yet). We came for the cycling, but this island gave us so much more.

We decided to travel with our new @rose_bikes_schweiz  gravel bikes as we were unsure about the terrain and wanted to explore the island in all conditions but most streets and passes are perfect for road cycling 

Thank you @vantastic_advanture for the drone shot ü´∂üèª

Some of our favorite climbs:
- Passo Kallikrati (the most hairpinned road of Greece)
- Imbross Pass from Hora Sfakion
- Katharo Oropedio from Kritsa
- Skinakas Observatory from Mourtzana or Gazi
- Amigdalokefali from Livadia
