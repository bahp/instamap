5 magical days in Zhangjiajie and around 🪭

🏮ZHANGJIAJIE:
1. Zhangjiajie National Forrest Park 1 day
2. Zhangjiajie Tianmenshan 1 day
3. Glass bridge and Canyon 1 day
*If you can stay one extra day, I’d suggest you visit the areas of the National Forest Park you couldn‘t see. The ticket price is for 3 days.

🏮From Zhangjiajie by train to:
4. Furong Town, the famous waterfall village (30min) 1 day
Here the highlight is at night, you can arrive for lunch and see the waterfall lighting up when is dark.

🏮From Furong by train to:
5. Fenghuang Ancient town (40min) 1 day, I recommend you stay the night, my best experience was during the morning while we made a stroll around the town. 

⏪From Fenghuang back to Zhangjiajie 1 hour train

📝Extra tips:
-Book train tickets up to 15 days in advance to avoid trouble.
-If you have a private driver distances are a bit longer, so consider the extra time.
-Tickets to Tianmenshan must be purchased in advance.
-If you have extra days spend them in the little villages for a more cultural experience. 
-If you only have 4 days, squeeze the glass bridge and Tianmenshan for the same day and stop by Fenghuang in the morning and Furong at night. Don’t cut time for Zhangjiajie National Park.
