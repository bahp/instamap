The California Sierras are my most visited destination, period. I can’t get enough of the mountains, lakes, and hot springs. To me, it’s like going to an amusement park. On this particular trip is was fairly cold 🥶 It was around 18°F (-7.7°C) but that didn’t discourage us from getting out there and taking that fresh mountain air. 

It just breaks my heart because for the better part of these last 2 summers this region has been covered in smoke and wildfires. So I’ve been hesitant to visit. According to the NPS “Nearly 85 percent* of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans. Human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, equipment use and malfunctions, negligently discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson.” It’s important to take care of ours lands so that future generations can enjoy these sights as well
