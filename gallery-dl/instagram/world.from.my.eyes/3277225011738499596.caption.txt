This has to be one of the most epic hikes that I did in Kandersteg last week. Seeing this person standing at the lookout, I couldnâ€™t stop myself from taking this shot. I spent almost an hour just sitting around this area admiring the scenery. The panorama trail above Lake Oeschinensee is a 3-5 hour hike and is a must-do on clear days.
