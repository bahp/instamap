Step back in time at Narai a beautifully preserved section of Nagano Prefecture’s Nakasendo Trail.

This kilometer-long stretch of road houses 50 historic buildings lined together, all consisting of inns, museums, cafes, and restaurants. While there, don’t forget to sample some gohei mochi, a speciality of the Chubu region. 🍡

Who would you travel this trail with?
