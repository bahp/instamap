Hokkaido beach in Japan is one of the most unique places in the world, where the ocean meets the sand and snow. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

This beach is located in Sanâ€™in Kaigan Geopark, which was declared a Japanese Geopark in 2008 and a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2010. Residing in the west of Japan on Hokkaido Island, the beach stretches from the eastern Kyogamisaki Cape, Kyoto to the western Hakuto Kaigan Coast, Tottori.
