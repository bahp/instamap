📌 Save this for when you visit Paris 🇫🇷✨

📍Café - Restaurant Le Jardin du Petit Palais

Located in the heart of my favorite museum, Petit Palais, this cafe is a hidden gem that you can’t miss! When you visit, I highly recommend sitting on the terrace and soaking up the beauty of the museum, fountain, and garden while having a delicious lunch. Petit Palais is free to enter, so you can visit this cafe for free as well! 🍴
