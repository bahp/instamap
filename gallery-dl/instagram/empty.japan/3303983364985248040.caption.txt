1. Ukimido Floating Hall, Shiga.

2. ⁠Ryuzoji temple, Hyogo - finding this place is quite challenging, it is hidden deep in the forest, almost on top of the mountain.

3. Aga Shrine, Shiga. 
Right before the Temple’s entrance there is a narrow path between rocks. It is believed that if you have a kind heart, then by walking along this path all your wishes will come true. But if you have a tainted heart, you will be crushed between these rocks.
