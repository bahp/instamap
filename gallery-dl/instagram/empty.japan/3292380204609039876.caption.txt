In ancient times, a year was divided into 24 periods and then 72 micro-seasons, each named to capture these fleeting moments. 

Some of my favorites include “Swallows return”, “Frogs start singing”, “Rotten grass becomes fireflies” and “Maple leaves turn yellow”. 

You might even notice seasonal decorations reflected in restaurant dishes and the patterns of yukata and kimono as the seasons transition.
