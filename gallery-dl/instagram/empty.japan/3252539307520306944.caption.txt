The first one is Daisugi - a really interesting forestry technique where it looks like a lot of trees are growing from one. You can find these all over Kyoto, but I’ve noticed they’re most common in the northern part.

The second is Kokonoe Sakura, a tree believed to have been personally planted by the emperor 650 years ago. Only one branch is well enough to bloom once a year.

The third is the Pine tree of “Yuryu,” one of the Japan’s greatest pine trees. Despite being only 2 meters tall, it spreads out over an impressive 50 meters wide.
