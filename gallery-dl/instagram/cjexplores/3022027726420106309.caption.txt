Have you been to Whitby Abbey? 🇬🇧 🧛‍♂️ 

It’s an incredible UK landmark located on the Yorkshire Coast 📍 

The atmosphere there is undeniable, with a history dating back to 657AD 😯 which is only increased with its connection with Dracula 🧛‍♂️ 

In 1890 Bram Stoker sat overlooking the Abbey ruins and it was their gothic charm that assisted his inspiration for the world-famous novel, Dracula 🧛‍♂️ 

Are you adding Whitby Abbey to your bucket list!? ✨
