This city was a very nice visit! It is located two hours north of Rome. 🇮🇹🚘

Known as the “dying city,” it was abandoned due to two violent earthquakes and the lack of security to live in it. 

You can only pass with a footbridge, which costs 5€ per person. Now the city has small coffee shops, restaurants, and bed and breakfast places for tourists. It could be a nice experience to stay for just one night and explore the evening as well. 

Save this place for destination inspiration in Italy 🇮🇹
