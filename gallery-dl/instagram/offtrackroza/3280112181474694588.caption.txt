Better & cheaper than the alps 🏔️ 

Hear me out! 😂 

🇰🇬 Kyrgyzstan is a country filled with the most INCREDIBLE landscapes, people and prices! 

Renting a car, less than $40-50 a day (sedan), food? $5-10 bucks a day. Hotel? Private room for $10USD. Yep! You heard that right! 🤑

🚙 We travelled this country for 2 months straight, going through every river, driving over every mountain and seeing every inch we could (with the help of @ironhorsenomads )

I’m telling you, visit Kyrgyzstan before it’s too late! If you want Switzerland scenery but with Thailand 🇹🇭 prices, GET. HERE. NOW!
