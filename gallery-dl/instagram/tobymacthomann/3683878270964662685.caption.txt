Tuscany you are beautiful and should be on your travel list 🇮🇹😍

Here are my favorite locations to catch the beautiful rolling hills

📍01 -02 : Crete Sensei is one of the most famous locations in the whole Tuscany. It’s always a dream at sunset, as you face the setting sun in late spring. You can leave your care right by the entrance on the side of the road. It’s very busy so be careful.

📍03-05 :Podre Belvedere is one of the most iconic locations in all of Tuscany is this stone house close to Quirico d’Orcia surrounded by cypresses.
I recommend you come at sunrise then you will have a magical lightning mood. You can park the car easy nearby the location on the street.

📍05-07 : Poggio Covili Viewpoint is in the heart of Tuscany, immersed in the greenery of the Val d’Orcia, in a hilly position, stands the ancient farmhouse.
Be there shortly before sunrise. If lucky you’ll get morning mist in the valley.

Tag someone special you would take here so see Tuscany’s rolling green hills during spring time 🇮🇹 🌳
