Hidden Historical Gem Not Far From Central
Tokyo🇯🇵

A short hop from the center of Tokyo is the traditional neighborhood of Jindaiji, a pleasant area with Tokyo’s second oldest temple, appealing soba shops and more! 

Jindaiji is the second oldest temple in Tokyo, originally built in 733. If you want to avoid the touristy feeling of Sensoji, Tokyo’s oldest, this is the place to come.
