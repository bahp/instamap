If you’re planning a Harry Potter backpacking adventure in the UK this is a heck of a trip to try to tackle all at once but here are some of my favorites we’ve visited so far! (This is by no means all of the locations used in filming 😉) I recommend starting in London and Oxford for tons of HP spots worth visiting 👍✨⚡️
