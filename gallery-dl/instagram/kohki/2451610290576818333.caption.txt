I spent the most vibrant time of the year with its reddest landscapes here in Kyoto😍 
This could be one of my favorite trips to Kyoto by far due to how unpopulated it was. I could really spend time to just observe the place, which made my photography experience that much better😌
I wish my photographs could showcase that same feeling I had of isolation and peace.
