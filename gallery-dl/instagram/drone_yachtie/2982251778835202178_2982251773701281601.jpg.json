    "description": "Koh Panyee is a small island in Phang Nga province. There are about 1,600 people from 360 families who live permanently on the island. All of them are the descendants, directly or indirectly, of Toh Baboo and his family and friends, who were the first people to settle on Koh Panyee some 200 years ago.\n\nToh Baboo and 2 other families left their homeland in Indonesia by boat looking for a new place to live. They made a vow to each other that if 1 of them found a place where there were lots of fish and where everyone could live, they would signal the others by raising a flag on a mountain as high as possible, so that the others could see it and join them. Toh Baboo discovered the island with its abundance of fish and, true to his promise, raised a flag atop its soaring cliff. That's how the island got the name, Koh Panyee (also written as Ko Panyi) - the Island of the Flag.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hellofrom #phuket\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nꜱʜᴏᴛ ᴏɴ #djiglobal #air2s\nᴇᴅɪᴛᴇᴅ ᴏɴ @lightroom\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#phuketthailand\n#floatingvillage\n#fishingvillage\n#kohpanyee\n#yachtcrew\n#shotondji\n#dronestagram\n#aerialphotography \n#aerialview \n#viewfromabove \n#dronephotography \n#droneshots \n#dronephoto \n#dronepic \n#droneporn \n#eclectic_shotz\n#visualscollective \n#infinity_worldshoot \n#majestic_earth \n#globeshotz \n#fantastic_earthpix \n#earth_expo \n#amazingplaces \n#drone_yachtie \n#skybangerz \n#dronemperors",
