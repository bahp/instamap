No, itâ€™s not Hakone or anywhere else near Kawaguchiko Lake. This place is still relatively unknown to many tourists. Mishima Skywalk is the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in Japan (400 meters). Located just one hour from Tokyo (see access information below), it can be a nice idea for a one-day trip. I recommend visiting this spot early in the mornings or evenings to enjoy a clear view of Mt. Fuji and Suruga Bay, as well as the gorgeous sunset from November to February ðŸ©µ
There are many other activities on the spot, such as the Long Zip Slide, an e-bike or Segway tour, and various cafes and restaurants to experience local cuisine. I also recommend trying the â€˜Sora soft serve ice creamâ€™ made with raw milk from the foot of Mt. Fuji. I still canâ€™t forget that smooth texture and fresh cream tasteðŸ¤¤
Let me know if you would like to visit this place one day! 

ðŸšŠAccess from Tokyo: Take the Tokaido-Sanyo bullet train from Tokyo station to Mishima station (about 55 minutes). Then, take the bus from the No. 5 bus stop at the south exit of the station (20 minutes).
