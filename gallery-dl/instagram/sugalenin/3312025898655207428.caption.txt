📍Jindaiji Temple （深大寺）, the second oldest temple in Tokyo, and the area around it showcase glimpses of traditional Japan. Though I didn’t have time to explore it for more than a couple of hours, without a doubt, you can spend the whole day in the area! Try soba noodles at one of the many local shops along the traditional street, pray at the temple, buy or even make your own pottery, and enjoy the hot spring (♨️Onsen Yumori no Sato). 
If you are in the area, I also recommend visiting 
📍Jindai Botanical Garden/神代植物公園 that is next to the Jindaiji temple (I’ll post about it later). 

🚌Access: get on the bus from Chofu, Tsusujigaoka, Mitaka, and Kichijoji train stations. Better check Google Maps before to see which bus suits you the best. The nearest station is Jindaiji (深大寺) bus stop.
