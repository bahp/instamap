What is the least populated prefecture in Japan?
That’s Tottori! 👋🏼

Despite its natural beauty, rich history, and incredible food, many people tend to skip Tottori for other destinations. Here are some must-visit spots beyond the famous Tottori Sand Dunes (which, despite popular belief, isn’t a desert).

📍 Mt. Mitoku – Climb to see Nageiredo Hall, Japan’s most dangerous National Treasure.
📍 Misasa Onsen – The world’s most famous radium-rich hot springs.
📍 Kurayoshi – Stroll through Edo-period streets in this Kyoto-like town.
Food
📍 Takumi Kappo – A restaurant considered the birthplace of shabu-shabu by the Japanese.
📍 Karoichi Fish Market – The freshest seafood in Tottori.
📍 Townhouse Seisuian – Try thinly sliced ​​mochi in a bonito broth pot.

🚉 Access: 1h20min by flight from Haneda Airport. International travelers can easily transfer via Tokyo (fly ANA for convenience) for a smooth journey. 
If you don’t drive, you can also use the affordable Gurutto Tottori Tourist Taxi from Tottori Station—only ¥4,000 per car for 3 hours.
