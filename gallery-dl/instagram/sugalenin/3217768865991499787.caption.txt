You’ve probably heard about Kawaguchi Lake near Mt. Fuji. But have you heard of Lake Saiko, which is the second smallest of the Fuji Five Lakes?
Next to the lake, find 
📍Iyashi no Sato Nenba- a picturesque village that offers visitors a unique and immersive experience in traditional Japanese culture. The name “Iyashino-Sato Nenba” translates to “Healing Village Farmhouse” and accurately reflects the essence of this enchanting place. The village is designed to recreate the ambiance of a traditional Japanese rural village, complete with thatched-roof farmhouses and stunning natural surroundings.
🚄Access from Tokyo (you can google busses too, I just prefer trains):

Take the JR Chuo Line from Shinjuku Station to Otsuki Station and from Otsuki, take the Fujikyu Railway Line to Kawaguchiko Station. From there take the Omni Bus Green Line (Saiko Line) to travel to Iyashi no Sato in about 40 minutes.
