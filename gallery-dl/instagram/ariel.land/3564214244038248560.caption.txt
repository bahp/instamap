🎆 Iiyama Snow Festival⛄️

The Snow Dome Restaurant runs from 1/24~2/28

At the time of posting this reel, there are still some snow dome dinner + stay plans for the last week of February! 

✏️ Booking site: iiyama-ouendan.net

You can also go without booking a plan, but you’ll need a rental car since buses don’t run that late and taxis are very scarce and overbooked right now in the area. 

🏠 Our plan is the one with a farm stay called のんびり田舎のかまくら物語 (The relaxed countryside Kamakura story) which is a 3min walk to the snow dome village! 

🎆 The fireworks is only on the first evening of the festival which is Feb 8th this year 

🚅 Tokyo to Iiyama is 1hr 38m on the Hakutaka (Hokuriku Shinkansen) 

⛷️ You can ski or snowboard nearby at Togari Onsen or Nozawa Onsen 

🔖 Save this for a special winter experience in Japan
