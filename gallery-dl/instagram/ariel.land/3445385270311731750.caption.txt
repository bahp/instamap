🚅 JR ticket secret? 🎟️

Did you know you can get beautiful free stamps when exiting a JR station? 

These are called “invalid stamps” 無効スタンプ which invalidates your tickets, aka it’s been used and can’t be reused. 

Not all stations have special designs, but I always walk through the manned booth to try my luck to see if I get a beautiful stamp! 

👦🏻 👧🏻 Stations that give out free stickers to kids: 
- Nasu Shiobara 
- Yamagata 

My favorite stamp is the Kawazu station stamp 🌸 featuring their early blooming breed of cherry blossoms! 

✏️ Do you know any other station that has beautiful stamps? Share below so we can all collect together!
