Happy winter solstice ❄️ 🌲 ☺️ first day of winter…even if it’s felt like winter since October/November 😂

Here’s my second attempt at this piece…you’ll see my first attempt at the end (it’s on the other side of this paper!). 

Doing a piece a multiple times is really valuable to me. Even if at times I feel like I never want to see a piece again 😂. 

I painted this with my @tintorettobrushes dagger and @silverbrushltd liner. 

Paint by @cozmickcreations_watercolors the dark blue is vivianite…my most used blue from Laura ☺️ with yinmin and lapis coming in close behind!
