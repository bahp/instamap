Nara Park is the only place to see in Nara? No way! While you SHOULD visit the deer park, that’s not all there is to the prefecture. There are so many amazing temples, shrines, nature spots, festivals, food and more. 

I recommend spending more time there and seeing what Nara has to offer beyond the deer park 🦌✨ There are so many more wonderful places I couldn’t fit into a short video like this. 

Shown in the video:
📍Mt. Yoshino
📍Takami no Sato
📍Tsubosaka-dera
📍Fujiwara Castle Ruins
📍Omiwa Shrine - rice planting festival 
📍Mt. Katsuragi 
📍Fujiwara Castle Ruins again 🌸

📍Kasuga Taisha 
📍Tanzan Shrine
