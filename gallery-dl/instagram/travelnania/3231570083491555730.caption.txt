NINH BINH TIP 

If you travel to Ninh Binh and want to take a beautiful boat tour among limestone mountains and lush greenery, you can choose between Trang An, Tam Coc and Van Long. All three boat tours are breathtaking, but...

PRO TIP: ...only the Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve boat tour offers a non-touristy, peaceful and affordable experience. Unfortunately, the other two are often overcrowded.

Located 30 minutes from Ninh Binh, Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve is the most remote option for those who want as untouched and relaxed vibe.
