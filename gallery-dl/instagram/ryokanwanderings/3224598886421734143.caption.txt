♨️DISCOVER KINOSAKI ONSEN TOWN

📍 Hyogo Prefecture, easily accessible from Kyoto, Osaka & Kanazawa 

✨ TATTOO FRIENDLY ✨

🍃 I spent a gorgeous time discovering this fabulous picturesque onsen town with its cobbled stone street, arched stone bridges, swaying willow trees 

🙏🏻 here’s a snapshot of what I got up too 

✨ soaked in the town’s public onsen baths 

✨ wandered the street in pretty yukata 

✨ dined at local yummy restaurants for lunch 

✨ browsed charming cafes & bookstores 

✨ rested my tootsies in their free onsen footbaths 

✨ enjoyed delicious sake & seasonal kaiseki at ryokans 

✨ relaxed in my Ryokan’s soothing onsen waters
