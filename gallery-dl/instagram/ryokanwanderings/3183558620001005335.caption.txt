♨️ 3 ONSEN RYOKAN ♨️

⛩️ WITH MAGICAL STUDIO GHIBLI VIBES ⛩️

🎥 I don’t know about you, but my childhood formative years & imagination were definitely influenced by the magic of Studio Ghibli movies 

✨ when you live in Japan, one can definitely stumble upon moments that feel like you’re in a Ghibli world & visiting onsen ryokan is no exception 🥰 here are 3 so far that made me feel like I’ve been living a Ghibli life 🙏🏻

🏮 SEKIZENKAN 🏮 Shima Onsen, Gunma Prefecture 🏮
perhaps one of the most famed onsen ryokan that is said to have inspired Miyazaki for Spirited Away & the red bridge ✨ its original main building holds the rooms with the iconic night time views & original public indoor onsen ✨ rooms are simple, traditional Japanese style with no bathroom (maybe a toilet) & is where I stayed ✨ a newer building with rooms having all the modern amenities (some with private onsen) is behind the original but lacks the iconic views & is pricier 

🍃 HAIYA RYOKAN 🍃 Awara Onsen, Fukui Prefecture 🍃
housed within a larger compound, is Haiya Ryokan’s original guesthouse annex from 1884 ✨ where you’ll feel like you’ve been transported to another world steeped in mystery & mystique ✨ 15 ornate traditional rooms beautifully decorated with stunning Japanese craftsmanship & antiques each with their own private mossy Japanese garden (some with private onsen & 1 with a opulent large private koi pond)

🪭 UEYAMA RYOKAN🪭Shiota Onsen, Hyogo Prefecture 🪭
over 140years old, this Ghibli-esque onsen ryokan draws it’s onsen waters from a source over 300years old ✨ located in at the foot of a mountain in a secluded area of Hyogo prefecture yet still easily accessible from Himeji Station ✨ rooms with a view of the pond & red bridge are in its original main building ✨ simple traditional Japanese style, some rooms do not have a toilet ✨ an annex building has newer rooms with more modern amenities (but no view) 

🙏🏻 hope you get to discover a bit of a Ghibli world in Japan
