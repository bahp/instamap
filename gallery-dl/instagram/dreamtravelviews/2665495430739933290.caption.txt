Landscapes in Indonesia range from dense tropical forests, home to millions of species to sprawling fertile basins of rice fields. The list continues from massive volcanoes to picturesque beaches, from sky-scraping mountain peaks to extensive dry grasslands. Indonesia boasts of sheltering various endangered animals as well as rafflesia - the largest flower in the world.

The Sunda Islands can be categorized into two parts - Greater Sunda Islands and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Greater Sunda Islands consist of Java, Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi, whereas the Lesser Sunda Islands consist of a chain of islands located in the east of Bali. There are other groups of islands also that provide different landscapes after a few kilometers only.
