Star Gazing in Norway

Aurvandil is a figure in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Aurvandil's toe, which had frozen while he was carried in a basket across the Élivágar rivers by Thor, was made into a star by the thunder-god. Here's a quick guide to the constellations you can see in Norway and north of the Arctic circle.

The 12 constellations of the zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. All of these, as well as the full circle of the zodiac, are easily visible in present-day star maps among many other constellations. The largest constellations in the sky are Hydra, Virgo, Ursa Major, Cetus, and Hercules.

When it comes to Arctic stargazing, winter is the absolute best time of year to visit Norway! According to the European Southern Observatory, stable winter weather patterns combined with the dark sky and low light pollution create prime astronomy viewing conditions.
