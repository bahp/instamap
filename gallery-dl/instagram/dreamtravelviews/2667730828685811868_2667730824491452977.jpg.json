    "description": "Iceland is often called the Land of Ice and Fire, a land where volcanoes and geothermal heat have made their mark on the landscape, along with the many glaciers and glacier lagoons, a land of pristine and unspoiled nature. \n\nIceland, the lonely island in the middle of the North Atlantic, has become a popular spot for Hollywood blockbuster films. And no wonder, the alien and strange landscapes seems easy to translate as either other planets, as in Star Wars – Rogue One or Prometheus, or suits as a setting for different fantasies, such as Game of Thrones. A land which the powerful elements, fire and ice, have molded and made their mark upon.\n\nIceland has many attractions and if you have the time, you encourage you to visit as many places as you can, once in Iceland. Nearly everywhere you go, you’ll see beautiful unspoiled nature, low but rugged mountains, volcanoes and lavafields, narrow fjords, viking horses and small picturesque villages. Whether you are in the Snaefellsness peninsula, the Westfjords, traveling south of Vatnajokull glacier, you’ll find breathtaking vistas and landscape like no other.\n\n📷 @cumacevikphoto \n\n😇 Post Patron: @classylady588 \n\n❤️ If you like it ❤️\n\n👍 Follow @dreamtravelviews for more\n\nIf you want to be featured for free in the next post, check out the story highlight \"Patron\" 😉\n\n__________________________________________\n\n#travellingthroughtheworld #traveladdict #explore #traveltheworld #travelgram #travelbloggers #traveler #photooftheday #travel #earthpix #earthoffical #awesome_earthpix #discoverearth #travelwithme #beautiful #beautifuldestinations #wonderful_places #goodlife #natgeotravel #artofvisuals #worldplaces #welivetoexplore #beautifullandscape #landscape #travell #travelpics #splendid_earthpix #neverstopexploring #dreamholidays #paradisefound",
