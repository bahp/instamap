    "description": "Though there's not a bad season to visit Italy, autumn is a favorite time of year for many travelers. Temperatures are mild, and crowds have mostly thinned out from their summer peak. Airfare prices tend to drop during this period as do hotel rates, meaning your money might buy you a nicer room in the fall than it would in the summer. In October and especially in November, you're more likely to encounter wet weather, so keep this in mind if you don't like sightseeing under grey, often rainy skies.\n\nAutumn is also a glorious period for eating and drinking in Italy, with opportunities to taste freshly pressed olive oil, precious white truffles, and delicate porcini mushrooms. Restaurant menus often change for the fall, meaning you'll be able to dig into lots of hardy comfort foods like pasta al forno (lasagna), polenta with ragu or mushroom sauce, ribollita (the thick vegetable soup of Tuscany), and other rich pasta and meat dishes. There's also a full festival calendar in autumn, with many events dedicated to the culinary specialties of the season. \n\nFind the best hashtags for your profile\n7 days free trial\n(Link in bio)\n\nLocations:\n\n1.
