Four dishes you can’t miss in Chinatown London this year 👇

1. All the rage in 2023, if you haven’t tried hand-pulled noodles from @kungfunoodleuk yet, then this is your sign 🍜

2. Another TikTok phenomenon, mango pancakes from @oseyouk should remain on your must-try list 🥭

3. Xiao Long Bao is an oldie but a goldie and they’re a must when ordering dim sum. Head to @leongslegend for a steaming basket of these 🥟

4. Brand new croissant rolls from @sakuradolondon - these soft and flaky croissants are filled with delicious chocolate or pistachio ganache 🥐
