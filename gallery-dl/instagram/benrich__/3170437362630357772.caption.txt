*Locations Listed* - When I left my London design job and moved to Japan 4 years ago, I never would have thought Iâ€™d be able to experience so many incredible places, and I certainly didnâ€™t think I would fall in love with the world of hotels like I have.

When it comes to hotels, Japan offers so much more than just a place to stay. World-class architects design unique hideaways deep in the mountains, and infinity pools overlook the worldâ€™s busiest city from 40 floors high, as well as traditional buildings being converted into modern day guesthouses - there literally is something to fit every travellersâ€™ needs. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
