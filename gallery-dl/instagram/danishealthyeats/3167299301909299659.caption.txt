sometimes simple is just bestttt! I always talk about how I prep a higher protein sweet treat to stash in my freezer for the week. This makes grabbing a healthier option super easy, you don‚Äôt even have to think about it. & being sure to include healthy fats & protein in your sweet treats, is important in keeping you satiated & balancing blood sugar üôè 

This cookie dough bark is vegan, requires no baking, & takes like 5 mins to make!

‚Ä¢1/2 cup of your fave protein (i used @macr0mike salted caramel - I have a discount in my bio ü§ç)
‚Ä¢1/2 cup oat flour (you can sub almond flour but you may need to use closer to 3/4 cup)
‚Ä¢1/4 cup melted coconut oil
‚Ä¢1/4 cup maple syrup
‚Ä¢1/2 tsp vanilla + pinch of sea salt
‚Ä¢handful of cacao nibs (full of antioxidants! Can also sub choc chips)
‚Ä¢1 cup chocolate chips

Mix together the cookie dough ingredients. Spread onto a lined baking sheet. Melt the chocolate. Pour over top. Sprinkle with sea salt. Place in the freezer for 2-4 hours until completely firm before breaking into pieces. Store in an air right container in the freezer!
