Hidden souvenir at Katsuo-ji🎴✨

Katsuo-ji is a temple located in Osaka known for its “daruma” dolls symbolizing good fortune, but did you know there’s a fun and unique way to remember your visit? I stumbled on this special stamp postcard and now it’s one of my favorite travel souvenirs (but you should still get a daruma doll too)!

Here’s what to do: 
💮When you arrive at Katsuo-ji, look for the stamp station before heading to the temple. Grab a blank postcard and a map with the stamp locations.

✉️Now, all you have to do is find each location (in order) and add the stamp to your postcard! It’s the perfect way to take home a personalized piece of Japan with you!

🪆In Japan, daruma dolls have a long history as symbols of perseverance and good luck. These dolls are traditionally used to set and achieve goals for your future! To follow tradition, color in one eye as you make a wish or set a goal, and when it’s achieved, fill in the other eye to complete your daruma! It’s a lasting symbol of success from Katsuo-ji 🎴

Save this post so you don’t miss this souvenir on your next trip to Japan!🎌
