Can you imagine these earthen buildings (Tulou 土楼) built by the ethnic Hakka and Minnan people of rural Fujian Province dates back to 700 years and were once mistaken for missile silos by American officials poring over satellite images? They have been inscribed as one of the 46 Fujian Tulou World Heritage Sites 🇨🇳.⠀⠀
The locals call these Tulou [四菜一汤] "four dishes and one soup” as the layout looks like a typical dinner setting of four plates and soup in the center."
