The world's largest salt flat may be Bolivia's 🇧🇴 claim to landscape fame, but the entire Bolivian Altiplano features breathtaking scenery. There are the highlands with rough and icy mountainous areas even volcanoes and then there are dense rainforests in the Amazon basin. Thus also the climate is very diverse. Western Bolivia is generally cold like in the Andes highlands. The eastern side of Bolivia is warmer, and it can get very hot in the plains and humid in the rainforest region of the Amazon basin.
