An extremely steep portion of the Great wall of China !

Apparently, many sections of the Great Wall are left abandoned, and so they turn out like in this video.

When added up, the sections of the Great Wall reach approximately a whopping 6,400 km, which is more than twice the diameter of Pluto. The wall is also longer than the diameter of Earthâ€™s moon, which is about 3,480 km.

Did you know that camping is allowed on certain sections of the Great Wall ?
Several travel agencies offer overnight camping trips to the Great Wall, where lucky travelers can pitch tents on living history and watch the sun rise over one of the greatest feats of architecture in the world.

Who'd like to camp there ?
