Pure magic ✨📚 You can find this surreal bookstore in  Dujiangyan Zhongshuge, located in Chengdu, China. This two-story bookstore was designed by architecture firm X+Living, and is a true wonderland for book lovers. C-shaped bookshelves and mirrored ceilings give off an extended, almost never-ending illusion. Would you spend the day here?
