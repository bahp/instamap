In the back you can see the majestic Mount Fuji !
"Throw back in February 2019, when I Graduated from College in Japan, my parents went to my graduation ceremony ! And then we have a trip to Mount Fuji. First time when I was in Japan was 14 years old, and it has been 10 years already. Time fly right ? I canâ€™t wait to be back to Japan again"
