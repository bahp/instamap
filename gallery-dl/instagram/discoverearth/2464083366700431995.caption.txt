The vast Inle Lake is located in the Shan Mountains in central Burma. Near its southern tip, the multi-tiered Phaung Daw U pagoda is home to golden statues. In the hills that rise near the village of Indein, the stupas of the Shwe Indein pagoda look like a field of golden arrows. Not far away, the forest has taken over the stupas of Nyaung Ohak. At the northern end of the lake, a wooden bridge connects the floating village of Maing Thauk to the shore. 

"Fishermen of Ä°nle lake "
Those images look like a painting, right ?
