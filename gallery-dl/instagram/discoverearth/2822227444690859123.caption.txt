Where we’d rather spend this Friday evening ✨🇮🇹 You can find the mesmerizing cave city of Matera perched on the hilltops of Basilicata, southern Italy. Often named one of the most unique spots of the country, Matera is truly breathtaking: the magical setting, rich history and remarkable architecture are all reasons it’s on so many travel bucketlists. Have you heard of it before?
