"Itâ€™s a nice feeling knowing places like this exist. This is a natural waterfall next to stunning rice terraces that we found one morning.
Sumba Island is one is the more challenging places to travel in Indonesia. The island is massive and missing a lot of infrastructure like roads, hotels, restaurants, etc. We spent 6-8 hours in the car every day on bumpy roads to get to each spot. I think itâ€™s worth it if youâ€™re up for an adventure."
