""Perseids over the Bohemian Forest" ðŸŒŒ Did you see the shooting stars last week? Thanks to the amazing weather conditions without the moon, I witnessed over 70 meteors in just a few hours. This photograph features the brightest Perseids I was able to capture overnight on August 12-13, when The Perseid Meteor Shower peaks. The composite image was taken from BÅ™eznÃ­k on the northern edge of the LuzenskÃ© valley in Å umava National Park. The whole location is in the middle of wild forests and is one of the darkest places in the Czech Republic. The night sky includes the central arch of our Milky Way Galaxy and the planets Saturn and Jupiter on the left side of the Milky Way. Make a wish! âœ¨"
