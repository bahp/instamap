The Sirao Flower Gardens, more commonly referred to as Cebuâ€™s â€˜Mini-Amsterdam,â€™ is one of the best attractions located in Cebuâ€™s Transcentral Highway that attracts tourists for its colorful fields of flowers. When the flower farm craze went viral on social media in 2015, hundreds of visitors flocked the barangay of Sirao to catch glimpse of the fiery multi-colored field of celosias â€” the main flower grown in Sirao Garden.
