Taining Danxia Hanging Temple, Fujian
Fujian is a province on the southeast coast of China, across from Taiwan. Most of the province is governed by the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, but some Fujianese islands, namely Kinmen and Matsu, are controlled by the Republic of China (Taiwan). It is one of the largest tea-producing provinces in China, as well as one of the countryâ€™s most affluent. Like most Chinese provinces, Fujian is made up of primarily Han Chinese; however, uniquely to Fujian and the surrounding areas, many of the Han residents identify as Hakka, a culturally distinct group of Han Chinese.
These temples are named because they seem to hang in the Taning Danxia landform on Dajingu Lake, Fujian province.
