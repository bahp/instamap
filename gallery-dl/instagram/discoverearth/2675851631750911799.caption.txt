Northern light magic ✨ Have you ever seen the Northern Lights in person before?

If not (or if you’d like to witness their beauty again), Norway is a great location for spotting this natural phenomenon. Some of the best areas in Norway are Tromsø, Kirkenes and Lofoten, all known to be in the heart of the aurora zone.
