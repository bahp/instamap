Harbin, China has some of the world's coldest weather and the world's biggest ice festival 🇨🇳. By the biggest sculptures (about 50 meters tall), by the number of visitors (10 to 15 million), by the number of ice and snow sculptures created (thousands), by the artistic achievement and the 'wow' factor... for all of these, Harbin's annual International Ice and Snow Festival ranks #1 in the world.
Record breaking ice creations are usually constructed annually. Walking around in the Ice and Snow World among exhibits set up like a small town of 25 blocks, visitors walk among creatively lighted and intricately carved ice buildings that have in recent years reached the 45 to 50 meter tall level.
