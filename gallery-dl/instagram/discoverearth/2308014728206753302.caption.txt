🇯🇴 #discoverjordan with @thefreedomcomplex : "Next up on the list is Jordan - it was a really close call between Portugal and Jordan for places you wanted to see on the feed, so here’s one from the amazing city of mysteries - Petra 🏛 this place fascinated me more than almost any other place I have been - on par with the pyramids in Egypt!
...➿...
Petra was carved out of desert rock, with tools and precision unknown to anyone really 🤯 - the construction started over 2000 years ago and carried on for 800 years! These incredible carvings measured up to 44m tall and 11m deep! How the heck did they do it?! "
