Rare photos of the City of the Dead 😧 Just outside of the village Dargavs (Russia), there is a medieval burial ground holding the remains over 10,000 people. Its history is surrounded by a mystery, and while people aren’t sure when it was first built, it certainly remained a beautiful memorial over the centuries with its curved-roofed crypts.
