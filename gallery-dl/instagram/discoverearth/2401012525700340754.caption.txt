How amazing is this picture ?

"All of the lights in this photo are brought to you by the stars. The blips in the sky are planets reflecting our starâ€™s light. The soft gradient on the horizon is our sun setting and the lights in the field are powered by solar fiber optic cables. 200,000 lights are in this field. {happy intro}
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away â€¦ {The scene turns dark}
One day 5 billion years from now our sunshine will be taken away as the earth gets vaporized by our sun. {Crescendo}
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters {The climactic finale}
At that point we will all become starlight ðŸ™‚ *APPLAUSE"
