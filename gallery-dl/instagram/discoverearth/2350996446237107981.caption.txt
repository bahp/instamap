"Bora Bora, a place so beautiful they named it twice. Of all the places in this beautiful world Iâ€™ve visited, French Polynesia is probably the most hyped. Although it carries large expectations and a hefty price tag, this island is a bucket list destination. Mt. Otemanu, a 727m dormant volcano rises in the background and looms over this incredible island. Endless days on the lagoon are capped off with quiet nights where it feels like life has slowed down and youâ€™re all alone. This morning, paddling along the lagoon at sunrise, was the highlight of my trip."
