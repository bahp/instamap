Mount Fuji’s distinctive, perfectly symmetrical peak has long captured the imagination of poets, painters and climbers alike. Scaling its lofty heights might seem daunting, but it’s possible for even inexperienced hikers to tick it off their bucket list. 

At 3,776 metres (12,388ft), Mount Fuji is Japan’s tallest mountain, and casts an awe-inspiring figure on the horizon that’s visible for miles around. There’s no need to restrict yourself to admiring its beauty from a distance, however. The ease of access, well-maintained and signposted trails, and lack of technical sections put the summit well within the reach of almost all aspiring climbers. To the top you'll be able to see Japan’s most magnificent sunrise.
