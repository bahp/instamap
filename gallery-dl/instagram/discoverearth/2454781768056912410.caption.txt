A few things you could do while in Cappadocia:

- Explore Cappadociaâ€™s most important historical points. The GÃ¶reme National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and you can spend the day exploring the fairy rock chimneys and rock formations as well as the beautiful churches and homes carved right into the rocks. These cave dwellings date back to the Roman era and were inhabited by Christians who retreated from the Roman Empire. The TokalÄ± and ElmalÄ± Kilise (Church of the Buckle and Apple Church) are some of the most richly decorated, and you should definitely see the beautiful frescoes that continue to stun visitors to this day.

- Another important sight is the underground cities, which were used by the Christians in the Byzantine era for protection against Muslim Arabs during the Arab-Byzantine wars.

- Another essential experience: the hot air balloon tour. Look out over the whole mystifying landscape and make sure to bring a camera along!
