@craig_richards_photography had planned on photographing the iconic Twelve Apostles at #sunset when he was treated to this unexpected and spectacular #bioluminescence display instead! Although you may not witness sparkling bright blue waves exactly like this along the rugged the Great Ocean Road (weâ€™re just a tad jealous, Craig ðŸ˜‰), we can confirm that this famous coastal #roadtrip in Victoria delivers simply magical scenery on any given day.
