This is Omokaru Ishi! 🇯🇵⛩️

📍Fushimi Inari Shrine

You can find this after the Senbon Torii or the thousand vermilion gates!

Omokaru Ishi literally translates to heavy or light stone. While in front of these stones, make a wish and focus your concentration on this wish. 

Once done, lift a stone and hold it up. If the stone is lighter than you expected, your wish will come true. On the other hand, if the stone is heavier than you expected, your wish will take time to come true. 

Why not give it a try when you visit Kyoto’s famous shrine.
