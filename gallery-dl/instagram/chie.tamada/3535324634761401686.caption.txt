@hightide_japan is officially one of my favorite stores in Japan. 😍✏️📒⌛

They sell everything from stickers, pencils, notebooks, and book bags in modern and new retro style design.

All of their products are simple, colorful, and unique. ✨

Luckily for US folks, they also have stores in Brooklyn and DTLA if you want to check it out!
