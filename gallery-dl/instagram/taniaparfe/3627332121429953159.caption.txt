This Swiss village has 12 residents. Zero shops. Infinite peace.

📍Corripo, Ticino, Switzerland 

Corippo used to be Switzerland’s smallest municipality — so small, they once had to choose a mayor from just 9 eligible people. Imagine being guaranteed a government job just by showing up.

The village is made entirely of stone, rooftops, houses, narrow paths, and it’s protected as a national heritage site. It hasn’t changed much in centuries, and that’s exactly the charm.

There is small local project, that is quietly transforming old homes into a “scattered hotel”, where you sleep in restored village houses, eat at the old tavern, and live like a local (if only for a night or two).

Just silence, mountain air, and the sound of your own pace slowing down.

Most travelers will never come here. But maybe that’s exactly why it’s worth it.
