Dolomites travel guide ⬇️

Here’s a 5 day itinerary if you’re planning a trip to the Dolomites region of Italy! 

Day one: Sass de Putia hike of around 4 hours, not very touristic and the food stops are incredible, best polenta of my life here. Afterwards a visit to Santa Maddalena and the church of San Giovanni, plenty of car parks to access the church, there will be lots of tourists here so be warned! 

Day two: The Tre Cime di Lavaredo hike, with an offshoot to the Cadini di Misurina viewpoint. Including the offshoot takes around 4-5 hours but is so worth doing the extra bit, one of my favourite views of the dolomites! 

Day three: Lago di Braies in the morning, rent a boat first thing as there won’t be too many people and afterwards complete the loop of the lake in around an hour. In the afternoon have lunch and a stroll around San Vigilio di Marebbe (this is where we stayed).

Day Four: Nuvolau hike, a beautiful circular loop with one of the most scenic lunch stops at the top. Takes around 4-5 hours with a reasonable ascent to the top. 

Day Five: Seceda hike, my favourite of the whole trip! Amazing panoramic views wherever you look. Cable car up to the starting point and then it’s a 3-4 hour loop. 

🏡 Where to stay: 
San Vigilio di Marebbe is really central to most of the places on this list and is a beautiful little village. I’d highly recommend staying at Residence Rautal as they have a beautiful spa you can use for free and it’s really quite cheap compared to a lot of places in the area. 

✈️ How to get there: 
We flew into Venice airport and rented a car, it’s around a 3 hour drive to the hotel and came with the added benefit of being able to spend a day in Venice on the way home.
