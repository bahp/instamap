Asked the Beast to take a video of me in my new library 💁‍♀️📚

This ‘library’ in reality is the beautiful Cărturești Carusel bookstore in Bucharest, Romania! 🇷🇴 

Located in the heart of old town, the store provides a quiet bright hideaway in the midst of the city. 

It does get quite busy, so if you’re planning a visit I’d recommend heading there as soon as it’s open to explore the massive labyrinth of books in both English and Romanian - they even have a cafe for your morning coffee fix ☕️ 

Have you ever seen a prettier shop? ✨
