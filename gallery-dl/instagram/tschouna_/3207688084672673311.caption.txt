😍😮‍💨 What a dreamlike hike! A breathtaking, alpine ridge hike with unique views of the beautiful mountains all around. This hike really needs to be on your list for this or next year. I did this hike in October and can still highly recommend it as long as there is no snow in the mountains - so go for it!

❗️One thing in advance though: this hike is an alpine hike (T4 according to SAC scale). However, it is absolutely suitable for people who want to start with it - BUT, I recommend you to take an experienced companion with you. Good shoes are required!

📍 The hike is in one of my absolute favorite cantons - the canton of Uri in Switzerland. There are several ways to reach the summit (called Rophaien). Either you take the gondola up from Riemenstalden and start from there, or you take the gondola (like me) from Flüelen up to the Eggberge and start the hike from there towards the summit. The ascent leads nice and steady first up to an intermediate level. After the ascent towards Diepen you will reach the ridge - here the spectacle really begins! The views will inspire you. The beautiful lake, which you can also see on the pictures, is the lowest section of the beautiful Vierwaldstättersee. The large summit cross towers above the summit at 2078 meters above sea level. A unique panoramic view is also a reward.

⛰️ On this tour you have the possibility to do a round hike and after the descent go back to the Eggbergen or to shorten the tour a bit and take the gondola from Oberaxen. But beware: this small gondola is not for the faint of heart. Thrills are guaranteed at this altitude!

🇨🇭The hike is also very suitable by people who live outside of Central Switzerland such as from Zurich, Basel, Bern, etc.. The arrival time is usually between 1-2.5 hours, depending on the place.
