🤩 This hike has really overwhelmed me! A beautiful ridge walk with an all-round view that makes you dreaming. This hike is one of my top hikes that I have done this year. Not only the ridge (called Arnigrat) is the highlight of the hike - also the beautiful nature, which shows itself on the whole trail is to enjoy. The hike is located in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland.

❗️One thing in advance: the hike is not to be underestimated in terms of altitude and the ridge is marked blue-white (alpine route / T3+ / T4). Please read all the information carefully.

✔️ You should be surefooted, as the grade is narrow. Technically it is not demanding and you do not need any additional equipment. If you don’t have any alpine experience, take a person with you, who already has experience. If you have already done alpine tours, then this one will most likely not be a problem for you.

📍 Starting point is Stöckalp (OW)

🥾 follow the waymarks in the direction of Stepfen, Wandelen and from there follow the alpine hike trail (blue-white) over the arnigrat and then towards flüeli ranft.
