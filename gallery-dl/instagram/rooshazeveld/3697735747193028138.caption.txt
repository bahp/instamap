The France you didn’t know you were looking for 🤍

This is one of the dreamiest parts of France, with golden stone villages, peaceful rivers, medieval castles, and gardens that seem made for slow afternoons. 

And if you’re road-tripping here, you might just wander over into the Lot (just as magical!), which I couldn’t resist sharing here as well.

General tips for visiting Dordogne & Lot:
🚗 A car is essential. Many of the prettiest places are tucked away off the main routes
🕰️ Allow at least a week if you want to explore a mix of villages, gardens, and castles at a relaxed pace
🌞 Summer is beautiful but can be busy, late spring or early autumn are quieter and just as lovely
🍽️ Try local specialities like duck confit, walnut cake, truffles, and much more
🛶 Don’t miss seeing the villages from the river. Canoeing is one of the best ways to take it all in

I’m sharing more detailed tips and itineraries in my other posts, and my full Dordogne blog will be live soon 👀
