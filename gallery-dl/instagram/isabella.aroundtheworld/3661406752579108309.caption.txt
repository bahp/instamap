Hidden gem in Europe 🚨

While most tourists travel to countries like Croatia and Italy, this country is mostly overlooked! BUT it’s actually SO WORTH a visit! 

I recently took a roadtrip through Croatia, Montenegro and Albania and added some stops in Bosnia! And I’m so happy I did! 😍

Just look at these videos! 

Here’s some places I recommend visiting for your first visit:

- Mostar
- Blagaj
- Pocitelj
- Kravica waterfalls
- Stolac
- Medugorje
- Kocusa waterfalls

Is Bosnia on your bucketlist yet? 😍
