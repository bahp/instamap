A fairytale town in north west France, Fougeres is over 1000 years old and home to the largest medieval fortress in Europe.

The town‚Äôs past feels like it‚Äôs been plucked straight from a book filled with magical stories and beautiful pictures.

Its walls and towers whisper myths and legends from the past, protecting Brittany from French incursions.

Today, the town retains much of its historic charm, with cobbled streets weaving through half timbered buildings, creperies and quaint boutique stores. Visitors can explore the castle‚Äôs walls and enjoy beautiful views over the town itself.
