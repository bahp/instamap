Breathtaking and rugged, that‚Äôs how I would describe the Crozon Peninsula in France üçÉ

This beautiful stretch of coastline is location within Brittany, in north west France. The crystal clear water and white sand beaches bring in people from all over Europe but nothing like the crowds of the French Riviera.

In Crozon you can expect to find deserted beaches, hiking trails to yourself, and it‚Äôs a whole lot cheaper too!

The closest airport is Brest around an hour away, but most people arrive in their cars and camper vans. It‚Äôs around an hour from Roscoff ferry port meaning it‚Äôs a popular location for British families wanting to escape into nature.

Think Cornwall, but French and with less people... if you enjoy walking, you have to try the GR34 hiking trail which is one of the most stunning coastal paths in all of France.

The best time to visit is June-August, the climate is similar to south west England - plenty of sunny days in summer with some rain mixed in. Temperatures reach the early 20s so is the perfect place to explore without struggling in heat!
