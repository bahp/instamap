It has taken me 30 years to realise that beaches don’t have to have palm trees and coconuts to be beautiful 🏖️

Nestled on the southwestern coast of Anglesey, Newborough Beach (Llanddwyn Beach in Welsh) unfolds like a dream 💭

Golden sands stretch from the hazy mountains of Snowdonia out towards the Irish Sea. It’s a view that made me shed a tear, there was a realisation that my heart will always belong in the UK no matter how much I love to travel away.

At the far end of the beach lies Ynys Llanddwyn, an isle of myth and legend, accessible by foot at low tide and the most romantic place to enjoy the winter sunset.

This enchanting island, named after the patron saint of lovers, St. Dwynwen, holds tales as ancient as the stars that fill the sky as the sun drops behind the horizon. The lighthouse remains a beacon for wandering hearts, while the ruins of St. Dwynwen’s Church act as a playhouse for the wild ponies that graze on the land 🐴
