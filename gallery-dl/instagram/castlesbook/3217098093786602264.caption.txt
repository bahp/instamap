The Castello Monforte is a castle and defensive complex in Campobasso, Italy. It is located on a hill overlooking the city.

The origin of the castle is disputed. Some authors[who?] date the castle to 1459, built for Count Nicola II dei Monforte-Gambatesa. Other authors date the castle to Norman times; a document from 1375 mentions a castle there. 

After the castle suffered damage during the earthquake of 1456, Cola Monforte refurbished the castle and surrounding structures and erected walls. During the 17th-century, the castle was abandoned and began to deteriorate. In the 19th-century, it was used as a temporary cemetery. In 1861, the castle was bought by the city of Campobasso.
