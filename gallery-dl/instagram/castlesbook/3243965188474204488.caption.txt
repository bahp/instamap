Finstergrün Castle is a castle in the state of Salzburg, Austria. Burg Finstergrün is 1,087 metres above sea level. The castle is believed to have been built in 1296-97 by Rudolf von Fohnsdorf.

In 1300 it was described as “a border fortress” between the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Duchy of Styria. During the 14th and 15th centuries it became the seat of the administrator who was in charge of managing the silver mines in Ramingstein. The first documented mention of the name Burg Finstergruen occurred in 1629.
