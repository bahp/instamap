One of the oldest Romanesque Spanish castles ‚Äì Castillo de Loarre - was built in the 11th-12th century on the land reconquered from the Muslims. The castle abbey became an important stronghold on the border between Christians and Muslims. It is believed there was a Roman outpost there long before the castle was built. The rocky landscape was a bit of a challenge for the architects. That‚Äôs why the castle‚Äôs structures are scattered across the area at different elevations and surrounded by a wall to unite them all. This layout was a military advantage. The castle is protected by several curtain walls ‚Äì the outer one was built in the 14th century, has 8 towers and is 172m long. The 3-floor keep with a basement  was built in front of the castle and was linked to it with a wooden bridge. The castle featured in many TV shows and movies like for instance The Kingdom of Heaven by Ridley Scott. Incredible footage by @esmovie üëç‚ù§Ô∏è
