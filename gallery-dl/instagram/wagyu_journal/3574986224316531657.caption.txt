A popular wagyu sukiyaki and shabu-shabu specialty restaurant in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture!

The popular lunch menu item is the "Beef Hitsumabushi Gozen," which is apparently limited to 20 servings, and the part of the meat is probably a thigh.

It is eaten as it is, then with yakumi (condiments), and finally with dashi (Japanese soup stock)!

The sirloin bowl was sliced so thinly that it was an art.
