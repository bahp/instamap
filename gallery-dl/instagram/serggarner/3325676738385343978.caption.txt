Feeling the rush of the ocean and the thrill of the wind as I cut through the waves yet again in the enchanting Los Roques, Venezuela. 🌊🏄‍♀️ A year ago, yet the memory is etched in my mind as clear as if it were yesterday. 🗓️

This sublime paradise, with its crystal clear waters and pristine islands, is hands down one of the most breathtaking places my kitesurfing journey has taken me. I can't wait to feel the thrill again. 🌴🇻🇪
