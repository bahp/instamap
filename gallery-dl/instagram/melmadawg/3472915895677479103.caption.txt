My Favourite HP themed airbnbs (plus some actual filming locations) part 1 ‚ú®

@cruxalnwick is one of my favourites with multiple HP rooms opposite alwnick castle which is used as Hogwarts in the first two films in many of scenes including flying lessons. I stayed here last November and it was one of the most memorable weekends I‚Äôve ever had especially with it snowing üå®Ô∏è 

@north_shire has two HP themed accommodations plus a lord of the rings one and all are truly so magical, they sleep 6 and truly the best place for a HP themed holiday,only 20 minutes away from Goathland station aka Hogsmede station 

Christ church Oxford which is used in many scenes as Hogwarts in the first two films,including the first ever scene we see of inside Hogwarts,where they walk up the iconic steps. Available to stay during summer,Easter,Christmas. Breakfast in the great hall comes with the booking!

Da Vere house Lavenham was used at Godrics Hollow in deathly hallows! Truly surreal sleeping inside the location used as Harry Potters home! Such a beautiful place!
