Found the location of the 3-train crossing from Suzume! I didn't even realize until I stumbled upon a bridge with photographers & ppl just waiting to capture the perfect scene of the 3 trains intersecting 🚉✨️

I stayed in the area from early afternoon till after dinner when the sun had set to finally capture this scene! I was so happy I managed to see it 🥹💗

📍Hijiri-bashi bridge (near Akihabara)
