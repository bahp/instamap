Photo by @stephenwilkes | Photographing Rockefeller Center during the holidays was particularly fun, as I had the good fortune to be shooting from the original private balcony of Mr. Gimbel, one of the founders of Saks Fifth Avenue. Observing holiday shoppers, ice skaters, and the beautiful Christmas tree from such a unique vantage point was totally memorable. Wishing everyone happy holidays! 
In the Day to Night series, epic cityscapes and landscapes are portrayed from a fixed camera angle, capturing fleeting moments of humanity and nature as light passes in front of the lens over the course of a full day. A select group of these images are blended into a single composite. The Day to Night Monograph has been released by Taschen.
