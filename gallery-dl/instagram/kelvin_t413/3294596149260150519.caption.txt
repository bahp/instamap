宝山寺📍Hōzanji (Nara, Japan) 
Originally, the vicinity surrounding Hōzan-ji served as a training ground for Buddhist monks, known as Daishō-Mudō-ji (大聖無動寺). Mount Ikoma, revered by the ancient locals, led to the selection of this area for religious training, established around 655 by En no Gyōja. Renowned figures like Kūkai (空海) engaged in spiritual practice here.

In the 17th century, Hozan-ji took root when Tankai (湛海) revitalized the training area. In 1678, Tankai erected a statue of Kangiten (Shoten), marking the official establishment of Hozan-ji.

During the Edo period, this temple flourished as one of the most esteemed Buddhist centers in the region.
