IKEA KIDS ROOM STORAGE âœ¨

I thought Iâ€™d share a round up of @ikeauk storage items we have in Hâ€™s playroom! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll agree their storage solutions for kids spaces are second to none, as well as most items being affordable & durable too! 

My fave finds by far are the BEKVÃ„M spice rack, which is such a fab price at Â£3 and makes the perfect shelfie for a childâ€™s space. Another Â£3 barg is the OSTBIT plate rack, which is highly versatile and can be used as a great Montessori item for young children. Stack with books, puzzles, providing easy access for little ones! 

Whatâ€™s your â€˜go toâ€™ storage from the motherland? ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
