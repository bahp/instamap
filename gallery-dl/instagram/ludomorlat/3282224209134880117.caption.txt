SIARGAO : the surfer’s island. 

Let me give you some hints about surfing and discovering SIARGAO the way you should 🤷🏼‍♂️

A few spots to surf : 

• Cloud 9 (the most famous of them all, the paradise spot. Grab a drink at Shaka for a perfect after session) 

• Ocean 9 (the quiet spot, for perfect sunset session. You’ll find beginners and advanced area meaning that whatever of what your level is you’ll be able to have a great time in the water). 

• Pacifico Beach (enjoy a perfect session at this shallow water spot. Perfect for beginners getting their first feels on the crushing waves) 

• Alegria Beach (after a full tour of the island, start the afternoon at this less touristic but fantastic spot)

The last two area also allow you to travel the whole east and north coasts of SIARGAO. Spot at the coconut tree road, rent a small boat at Maasin River and explore to reach the secret lagoon, have a perfect lunch at Burgos (I recommend Lokal hub restaurant) or end the day at the @siargaowakepark for sound and wake ride. 

If you’re scared of driving over there, no worries it’s pretty safe and tbh the scooters there are some of the strongest and resistant ones I’ve ever seen. Get yourself on some dirt roads to find your hidden gems 💎
