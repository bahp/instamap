Azores Islands - Portugal 🇵🇹 
📸 @klaasbackers / @lukekellytravels 

📍 The Azores archipelago is undoubtedly one of the places with the most beautiful landscapes in the world. 🌍🌋
From the volcanoes to the beautiful trails and black sand beaches, the islands of the Azores are full of colour and incredible sensations. 🌲🌴
In winter, rain and fog fill the islands waterfalls and streams, while in summer hydrangeas and purple reeds fill the archipelago's valleys and mountains.  Definitely one of the places to visit if you want to experience nature and do the best walks of your life! 💛🥾🍂
