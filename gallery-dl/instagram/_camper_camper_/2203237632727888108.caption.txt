You wanted more pics of Rubi, so here is a hand full to show off the kitchen area! .
.
It’s rigged out with a massive sink with sprinkler tap, duplex oven & grill, vertifrigo 50L fridge/freezer and loads of storage space with over head cupboards and a wire basket larder cupboard. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of worktop space in Rubi but to overcome this I made a solid oak chopping board that drops neatly into the sink, if that’s not enough the Laguna table can be mounted at the same height as the worktop to give another full work surface. .
