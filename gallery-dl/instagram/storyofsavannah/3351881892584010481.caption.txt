Science Fiction Bokhandeln is a renowned fantasy book store in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪 

📍Science Fiction Bokhandeln is located in Stockholm’s Old Town (Gamla Stan). The Old Town is one of the most historic and picturesque areas of Stockholm, known for its cobblestone streets, medieval architecture and charming alleys. 

📖 The bookstore offers a wide selection of sci-fi and fantasy books, graphic novels, merchandise, and collectibles. It is completely free to enter and browse, however take it from me, it’s hard to leave empty handed! 

⚡️If you’re a Harry Potter fan, head upstairs to the dedicated Potterhead area where you’ll find magically decorated sections dedicated to all of the Hogwarts houses.
