@_thetravelher takes us up into the clouds to Machu Picchu, Peru and it’s every bit as magical as you imagined 🇵🇪🏔️

Whether you hike the Inca Trail or take the train from Cusco, nothing quite prepares you for the moment those ancient stone terraces appear through the mist. It’s history, mystery, and jaw-dropping views all at once.

Planning to go? Visit during the dry season (April–October), book your entry in advance, and don’t skip the sunrise, it’s worth the 4 a.m. wake-up! 🌄🦙

Would you trek or train your way there? 🛤️ 👣
