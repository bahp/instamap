What a Magical golden hour in Thailand !🌅🧡

 💡Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun.

🏷Have you ever been to Thailand ?🤩
