This was an experience I will never forget. It is so creative to make onsen hot spring bath to be coin operated. Some additional info, it is ¥2400 for the hour only. Booking opens 7 days prior so not anytime. This room, like the song I chose is called SUZUME 🫶. 

This is 📍 @hyotanonsen_official in Beppu
