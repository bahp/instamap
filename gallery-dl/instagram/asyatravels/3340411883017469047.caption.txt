Visiting @VisitRedding for several days to see some of the most beautiful waterfalls in California and much more. This is our first stop 😍 [АD]

📍 Phantom Falls in Oroville, California

🚙 90 min from Redding, it is a perfect stop on the way to Redding from San Francisco, Sacramento or Los Angeles.
🚶‍♀️ 4 miles round trip, longer 7 miles loop is also available. It is rated as moderate on AllTrails but it felt pretty easy. The elevation gain is 500 ft.
We took a shorter hike and saw 2 gorgeous waterfalls there including Phantom Falls of course.
🌼 It is full of wildflowers right now! Poppies, goldfields, gilias, and many more!
🌅 We went twice and I loved afternoon+ sunset more as the lighting was gorgeous.
🪨 There's also a trail down to the waterfall and there's a cave at the bottom. We tried to go but it was slippery after the rains so we decided to leave this part for the next time.
🐶 The trail is dog-friendly.
✈️ Drones are not allowed.

Please always remember to leave no trace: explore responsibly, pick up all waste, don't disturb nature and be considerate of others 🌼
