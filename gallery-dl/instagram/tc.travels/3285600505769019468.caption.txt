USA Hiking Bucket List for 2024 ⬇️

🏔️ High Rock Lookout: 3.2 mi / 1,328 ft elevation gain. Going here for sunrise is a must. If you’re as lucky as we were, you’ll witness a cloud inversion which is actually relatively common around Mount Rainier

🪽Angels Landing: 5 mi / 1,827 ft elevation gain (permit required) Towering over southwest Utah, this is of the most infamous hikes in the US known for its steep drop offs and chains you need to grab while hiking 

🔵 Colchuck Lake: 8.7 mi / 2,342 ft elevation gain. Carving through The Enchantments, this lengthy trail leads you to a group of blue lakes that are literal eye candy. This one definitely gets crowded so plan to start early

🌊 Awa’awapuhi Trail: 5.8 mi / 1,863 ft elevation gain. Leading you to the magnificent cliffs of the Na Pali coast on Kauai, this trail will throw you up against the elements of the powerful Hawaii. Unmatched views of ridgeline and coast 

🧗‍♂️ Half Dome: 16.5 mi / 5,305 ft elevation gain. Considered one of the scariest hikes in the US, climbing the cables at half dome is a right of passage for hikers around the world
