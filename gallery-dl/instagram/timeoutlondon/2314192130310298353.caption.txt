Even if you actually like cooking, whipping up three meals a day is probably wearing thin by now. Not to mention the worst part of all: the washing up. Thank God, then, that Londonâ€™s restaurants are starting to reopen for takeaway and delivery. The latest cult favourite to fling open its doors (metaphorically, you canâ€™t eat in) is Din Tai Fung, meaning you can get its dumplings delivered to your door.

Available via Deliveroo, the menu is slightly reduced and doesnâ€™t include its signature soup dumplings. But there are plenty of other options for you to get your fix. The menu features jiao zi and shao mai (prawn and pork, pork and vegetable, vegetable), steamed buns (chicken, pork, chilli crab and pork) and wontons, including the prawn and pork with black vinegar and chilli oil which our food editor @taniaballantineÂ described as â€˜one of the best dishes hereâ€™. ðŸ˜‹ ðŸ¥Ÿ
