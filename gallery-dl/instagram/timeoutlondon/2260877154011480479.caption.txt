Modern Soho Sri Lankan restaurant @kolamba.ldn gets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ from Time Out's Food Editor Tania Ballantine: "From the kitchen, there were flashes of brilliance like the fish cutlets – aka spiced mini fishcakes with deep-fried coats – that were good enough to rival my dad’s (which are legendary). Best of all: the creamy and comforting cucumber curry. You Must Get This. (At £5.90, it’s also a steal.) Hoppers were decent, string hoppers – that rarest of steamed delights – even better."
