Ever walked past this technicolour tiled house in Chiswick and wondered how it came to be? On closer inspection, you'll find it to be much more than a pretty patterns. In fact, its subject matter is particularly poignant in 2020.
â€‹
â€‹â€‹Artist and craftsperson Carrie Reichardt spent almost 20 years transforming this house on a quiet Chiswick street into a mosaicked wonder.Â She discovered the skill after a mental health crisis in 1995, finding it to be meditative, and started with designs based on Indian textiles around the door of her property.
â€‹
â€‹Her art practice changed in 2005 when her pen pal, US death row inmate Luis Ramirez, was executed. Traumatised by the experience, she started to use arts and crafts as a tool for activism and political protest.
â€‹
â€‹Carrie dedicated the back of the house to injustice by referencing her pen pals in prison: political prisoners including the Angola Three and Black Panther Kenny â€˜Zuluâ€™ Whitmore, who was represented by a flying eyeball. This section was completed with the help of a whole heap of artist friends, activists and volunteers. â€‹
â€˜Art is a powerful way we can open dialogue on difficult, painful conversations.â€™ she says.
