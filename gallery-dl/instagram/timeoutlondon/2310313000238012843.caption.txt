Amazon is great if you know what you're looking for â€“ but nothing will ever come close to the joy of browsing one of London's independent book stores or asking their knowledgable staff for recommendations. â€‹
â€‹@librerialondon is one of our favourites â€“ a place where printed words on physical pages are so important that using your phone within its walls is banned. We're looking forward to being able to hide in amongst its shelves when restrictions are lifted, and until then you can DM their Instagram account to ask for new lockdown reads.
