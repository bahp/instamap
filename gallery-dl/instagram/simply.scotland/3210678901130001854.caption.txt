Have been to this castle thats set on Loch Awe and set against the backdrop of the mountains of Tyndrum?

Kilchurn Castle was built around 1450 by Sir Colin Campbell, first Lord of Glenorchy. The land on which the castle stands had been granted to Colin in 1432 to ensure his loyalty following the sudden death of his elder brother, Gillespic. Colin‚Äôs descendants, the Campbells of Glenorchy (later earls of Breadalbane), were the most powerful of the numerous cadets of Clan Campbell. Indeed, there were times when this branch almost rivalled the clan chiefs, the earls of Argyll, for supremacy.

Similar to many other castles, Kilchurn was subject to the changing political climate of early modern British politics. It was fortified into modern barracks capable of housing 200 troops by Sir John Campbell during the English Restoration. During the Jacobite rebellions of the early 18th century the castle acted as a government garrison. The Glenorchy-Campbell family continued to own the castle until around 1760. It was abandoned after being permanently damaged by a devastating lightning strike. It then remained largely undisturbed, as it fell apart due to decades of neglect.

Today, Kilchurn is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Although it stands open to the elements, several wooden staircases and walkways built into its fabric allow visitors to climb the original five-story tower and other parapets.
