The beauty of Vietnam is captured in every corner of the country✨🇻🇳

💡Vietnam is home to the world's largest cave, Hang Son Doong. Stretching over three miles, Hang Son Doong is a natural marvel. It's wide enough to fly a Boeing 747 through and many of the cave's chambers are large enough to house an entire block of New York City skyscrapers.
