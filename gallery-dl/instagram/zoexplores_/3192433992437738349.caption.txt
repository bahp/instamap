Save this for your next trip to Edinburgh!

Welcome to The Gently Mad in Edinburgh📚

🌧️This is the perfect rainy day activity when you’re visiting Edinburgh. 
🚶🏽‍♀️The bookshop is just a short stroll away from Edinburghs Botanical Gardens🌺 (great sunny day activity when visiting Scotland☀️). 
🕰️The bookshop makes you go back in time, the smell of dusty books and old leather volumes welcome you when entering the shop. 
🗃️Apart from books they also sell 19th century vintage postcards which you can browse through in the store.
