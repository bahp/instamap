⬇️Everything you need to know when traveling through Scotland by train🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🚂

1. Buy a ScotRail travelpass (https://www.scotrail.co.uk/tickets/combined-tickets-travel-passes). They have multiple travelpasses suitable for different parts of the country and for a different amount of days.

2. Plan ahead. The travelpasses give you unlimited travel on a set number of days, so make sure your travel plans align with the amount of days that you can travel with the train pass.

3. The passes are valid on trains, buses and coaches. Just activate the pass each day you want to travel with it and you will receive a QR code for the rest of that day.

4. What route did we take? We bought the Scottish Grand Tour ticket. Giving me 4 days of unlimited travel for 8 consecutive days. We went from Edinburgh to Glasgow. From Glasgow to Fort William. From Fort William to Portree (Isle of Skye) and from Portree all the way back to Edinburgh.

5. Two important tips: the pass in valid only on off-peak hours (which was perfectly fine for us) and the ferry from Mallaig to Armadale (Isle of Skye) is not included.

😍Fun fact: the Scottish Grand Tour pass is valid on the West Highland Line in Scotland (considered one of the most scenic train routes in the world!)🤩
