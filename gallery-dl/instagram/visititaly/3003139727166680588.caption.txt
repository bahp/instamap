Craco - a ghost town in Basilicata âœ¨

Craco was slowly abandoned since 1963 after a landslide that hit the territory. In the last few years the town has become a point of interest for many tourists that are fascinated by its desolated streets. The town is also the set of many famous movies as the Passion of the Christ and Quantum of Solace.
