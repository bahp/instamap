A better alternative to visit in Seoul ⬇️

Bukchon Hanok village is one of Seoul’s most recommended places to visit for tourists… and I don’t really know why. 😅

The village with its narrow alleys and unique architecture style offers a glimpse into the Joseon dynasty and you can visit teahouses, artisan shops Hanbok rentals there but the place has become quiet overcrowded and authorities and locals have long been dealing with rude and loud tourists.

An excellent alternative to the Bukchon Hanok village is the Eunpyeong Hanok village with waaay less crowds (there were hardly any people there when I went).
It is located in the outskirt of Seoul, so you need to take a bus there (take the Blue Bus line 701) but on the plus side you will have no crowds + the scenic natural backdrop of the Bukhansan Mountain, that the Bukchon Hanok village doesn’t have!

There’s also a great café in Eunpyeong Hanok village called 1인1상 (1 In 1 Sang) that I have covered in my previous reel about 3 crazy cafés in Seoul!
