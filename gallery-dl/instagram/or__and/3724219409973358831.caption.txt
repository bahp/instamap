🇯🇵Japanese Pancakes. 50년이상된 팬케이크 전문점. 아침9시 오픈하자마자 만석되었고 79세 사장님과 아내분께서 함께 운영하는곳입니다. 

주문즉시 반죽부터 만들어 굽기때문에 조금기다려야했습니다. 아이스커피랑 핫케이크(2단) 세트 총 950엔. 가성비 좋음!

📍16-8 Oyama Kanai-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo

🥞A Pancake specialty café that fills up as soon as it opens at 9 a.m. This retro kissaten has been in business for 51 years, run by a 79-year-old owner and his wife.

*Kissaten: A traditional Japanese-style coffee shop that serves coffee, light meals, and desserts.

Since the batter is made fresh after you order, there’s a bit of a wait. I had iced coffee and a stack of two Pancakes — total was just 950 yen. Very reasonable price!
