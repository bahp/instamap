📍Lotus Lake in Tam Coc. To get there you need to go to Mua Cave which is complex of different locations including cave, lotus lake and viewpoints on Tam Coc River and mountains. 
🪷 This lake is amazing with thousands of flowers and path constructed in a shape of Lotus (you can see it from viewpoint). Some of them are flowering, some just about and some of them are dead. 
🎟️ Ticket entry 100k (£3) and definitely worth it!
