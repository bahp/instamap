Château de Fougères is a medieval fortress located in Brittany, France. Dating back to the 11th century, it was originally built as a wooden fortification before being reconstructed in stone during the 12th and 13th centuries. Strategically positioned on a rocky promontory and surrounded by a natural moat, the castle played a key defensive role during conflicts between the Duchy of Brittany and the Kingdom of France. It features massive stone walls, 13 defensive towers, and a well-preserved inner courtyard. Today, Château de Fougères is one of the largest and best-preserved medieval castles in France, attracting visitors with its rich history, stunning architecture, and interactive exhibits.
