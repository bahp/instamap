Satzvey Castle is one of the most beautiful moated castles in the Rhineland. The first documented mentions date from 1396, but it is assumed that the foundation walls of the castle house are even older. In family ownership for over 300 years, Satzvey Castle is still the residence and ancestral home of the Counts Beissel von Gymnich family.
