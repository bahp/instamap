    "description": "Breuberg Castle üè∞\nGermany üá©üá™\nCredit üì∏ @stefanpohlfilm üëèü§©\n--\n--\nThe Breuberg Castle Burg Breuberg is among Germany's best preserved castles. The so-called Kernburg arose at the beginning of the 13th century and was founded by the imperial abbey of Fulda in order to protect its Odenwald estates.\n\nAround 1200 the bailiwick was taken over by the Lords of L√ºtzelbach, who thereupon called themselves Lords of Breuberg. In 1323 already, the male family line of the house of Breuberg died out with Eberhard III. of Breuberg. From the 14th century, the castle was expanded many times, making it today a journey through the building styles of the last 850 years. In 1446, Count Wilhelm of Wertheim sold Count Philipp the Elder of Katzenelnbogen his share of the castle for 2400 Gulden.\n\nThe castle may have been damaged but was never destroyed, and was always used, thus explaining its good condition. Today the building belongs to the State of Hesse and serves as a youth hostel and a museum.\n--\n--\n#breubergcastle\n#germanyüá©üá™ #germancastles #castlesofgermany",
