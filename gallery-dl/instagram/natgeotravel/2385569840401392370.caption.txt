Photo by @junmichaelpark  Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul was built in 1404 during the Joseon dynasty. Its Huwon (Secret Garden) is known for its cozy ambience and balanced design between nature and architecture. In spring and autumn visitors can participate in the Moonlight Tour, which has become hugely popular; tickets are coveted. The palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.
