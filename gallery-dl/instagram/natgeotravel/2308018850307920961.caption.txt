Photo by @joshuacogan | A farmer works in a rice field near Hampi, in the Karnataka state of India. Since much of the state has been on lockdown because of COVID-19, authorities have had to ration rice to citizens, especially in more urban areas. As one of the top rice-producing states in India, Karnataka has also been helping to feed Kerala and other states during the lockdown.
