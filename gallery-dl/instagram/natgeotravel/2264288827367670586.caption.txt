Photo by @kevinfaingnaert | Itâ€™s impossible not to fall for the charm of the medieval village of Saint-Emilion in France. There is magic behind every corner of the historic monuments scattered around the town. Even the old stones seem inspired by the spirit of a painter. Their ocher hues reflect the sun's light all day long. #France
