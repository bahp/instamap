Can’t believe I’m here! 3,000kms ahead of me; from the southern tip to the northern tip of New Zealand. Going to be a wild ride and I can’t wait to get started. Day 1 was flat and fast, with way too much road walking. There were some nice trails scattered throughout but looking forward to better trails as I get further north. I left Bluff at sunrise and made it to Invercargill for a feed and resupply before trekking further to Beach Road Holiday Park - a great little camping spot with very friendly owners! Onto the beach tomorrow!

Day 1: 46.8km, 500m elevation gain 
Total: 46.8km, 500m elevation gain
