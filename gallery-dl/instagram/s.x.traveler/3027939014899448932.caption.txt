📍Achadas da Cruz, Madeira, Portugal 🇵🇹 

Teleférico das Achadas da Cruz can take you down from a huge cliff to an incredibly unique spot on Madeira, which is the traditional village of Fajá da Quebrada Nova. 

Nestled away on the north-western coast of Madeira, the small parish was once home to hundreds who tended to their livestock and agriculture. Today, many of the small, traditional homes have been unoccupied for years. 

Share with friends and bookmark. Don’t miss this unique spot exploring Madeira. 

Visit it just before the sunset for the best pictures in your Instagram 😉
