& here’s why 👇🏼

Mykonos - 6/10 🏝 It’s pretty but not very authentic, and it DRAINED my bank account 😭 but we had some of the most fun days there - great for beach clubs and nightlife 

Milos - 100000/10 🏝 My favourite Greek island by far. The water is amazing + we stayed in the most incredible Airbnb that lead directly onto the beach. Would go back in a heartbeat 

Paros - 9/10 🏝 My second favourite island, it’s a cheaper, prettier Mykonos. Great restaurants + bars and we loved exploring Lefkes. Plus we stayed in a great hotel where they made the BEST mojitos 

Santorini - 7/10 🏝 Only visited for the day so I feel like I can’t judge it as fairly as the others but we loved what we saw of it. So so pretty. It wasn’t that busy when we went so I might say differently if I went again. Also very £££

Syros - 8/10 🏝 Loved this island - super authentic and laid back. Had a really great experience hanging out with our Airbnb host and his friends. We had some really good meals here too.

Naxos - 6.5/10 🏝 I didn’t like it as much as the other islands BUT we had some amazing meals and went to some really good bars

Rhodes - 9/10 🏝 So unexpected but we LOVED it. Booked a very last minute trip in October with my friend and had the best time. Some of the most beautiful beach clubs (which were affordable too) and a really good night out. Also loved Lindos
