📍 Wharton Beach, Esperance 

We were told we missed out big time when we didn’t visit this beach on our first lap of Australia, now we can understand why! 

Make sure to visit if you’re travelling to Esperance, it’s a bit of a trek out of town but there’s heaps of camping nearby and seeing those blues in person is definitely worth the drive 😍

Make sure you SAVE this post if you’re planning your own Australia travels and follow @jack.and.megan for more bucket list locations!
