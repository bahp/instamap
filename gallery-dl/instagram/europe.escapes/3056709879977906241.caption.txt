Less than an hour north of Rome lies Calcata, a medieval village clinging to a volcanic cliff surrounded by the densely-wooded Treja valley. 

With its rugged tufa walls and steep pathways, entering this mystical, car-free hamlet it’s like stepping back in time or falling into a dream where Woodstock meets Hansel and Gretel. ❤️💚🇮🇹
