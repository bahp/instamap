Standing alone in the middle of a green field near Schwangau, a village in southern Germany, is the pretty little Pilgrimage Church of St. Coloman (Wallfahrtskirche St. Coloman). Situated against the backdrop of the beautiful mountainous landscape, St. Coloman is located at a lonely spot amid verdant meadows and under bright, clear skies.

This baroque church was built in its current form in the 17th century on the ruins of an earlier small field chapel erected in honor of St. Coloman. Apparently, the Irish pilgrim is said to have grazed his cattle and taken rest in this area during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the summer of 1012.
St. Coloman is now honored as the patron saint of horned cattle and horses.

Due to its idyllic setting at the foot of the Schwangau mountains (Schwangauer Berge) and its proximity to the world-famous Neuschwanstein Castle, the delightful church is one of the most famous sights in Bavaria (Bayern)

The high tower has an onion dome under the octagon of the upper floor. The substructure is square and is only interrupted by narrow light slits. The church was beautiful on the inside in its simplicity and beautiful decor.
