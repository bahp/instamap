“Why do we live in a van and not a house or flat with more space and comfort? Because moments like this are worth much more to us than all the comforts and stability in the world. We enjoy experiences, moments, new people, stories and laughs. Sunrises and sunsets in a different scenary every day. Because at home we didn’t live and here we fall in love with life everyday.🖤✨”
