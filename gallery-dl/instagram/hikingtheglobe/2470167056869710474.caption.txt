Slovenia is a hiking paradise and needs to be the next stop on your hiking vacation travels. In a country the size of Massachusetts, there are over 6,000 miles of hiking trails. The trails range from dirt roads and paths in the highland to well-crafted marked mountain trails in the most rugged mountainous regions. Trails lead from the depths of the valleys, past mountain huts and on to the summits of the Julian Alps. Who would you hike here with?⁣
