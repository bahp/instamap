In the heart of California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, Yosemite National Park is home to one of the world’s most striking and iconic views — towering granite domes, gushing waterfalls, and diverse habitats provide the perfect setting for pit door recreation. Here people hike through the dramatic landscapes, explore ancient giant sequoias, ski across snowy meadows and challenge themselves to grow as individuals and stewards of the planet. How many times have you hiked here? 🏞⁣⁣
