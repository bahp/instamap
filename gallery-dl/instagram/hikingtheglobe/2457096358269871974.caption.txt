The Italian Dolomites may not have the height and grandeur of the snow-covered French peaks or cute villages and steep-sided valleys of the Swiss Alps. But what sets the Dolomites apart are the dramatic limestone peaks. Crags that soar out of rolling green meadows. A landscape different from other alpine areas – where the change from rural idyll to inhospitable mountain is swift and stunning. Who would you take a hike here with? ⁣
