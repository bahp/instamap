The Temple of Hathor is one of the most well-preserved temples in all of Egypt. The vibrancy of the Ancient Egyptian blue is striking, considering that the temple is over 2,000 years old.

The temple is built and decorated using Egyptian, Greek, and Roman styles. It is dedicated to the goddess Hathor. She was the Egyptian sky goddess of love, fertility, music, and dancing. It is also said she is the goddess of birth and motherhood. She is often depicted as the counterpart Horus. In fact, her name Hathor translates to “House of Horus.”
