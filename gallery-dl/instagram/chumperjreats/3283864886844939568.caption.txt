📍Chuka Soba Tomita / Tomita Ramen
Japan, 〒271-0092 Chiba, Matsudo, 1339 高橋ビル

This is PEAK tsukemen. Worthy of a pilgrimage if you want to know what the ceiling is like for ramen. The store is located in Chiba, Matsudo which is about an hour away from Tokyo. 

Chuka Soba Tomita prior to shifting to the online reservation system used to be a multi hour wait. Now, reservations are released one week in advance on Omakase and there’s only 7 seats available for each time slot. Reservations go by quickly so you have to be ready on the dot. We recommend adding your payment information in your profile so checking out will be easier. There’s also an extra fee when completing the reservation.
