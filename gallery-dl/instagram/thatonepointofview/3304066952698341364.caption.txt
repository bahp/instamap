One of the most peaceful places we explored away from the crowds in Kyoto.

Make sure to add this one to your itinerary! 

üìçOtagi Nenbutsuji Temple

It may look out of the way on a map, but it‚Äôs very easy to combine with a half day trip to Arashiyama (first see the bamboo forest as soon as possible in the morning, then enjoy a peaceful 30 min walk through Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street to Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple). 

You can take the train to and from Arashiyama from down town Kyoto. However we didn‚Äôt find much public transportation to get around Arashiyama. That wasn‚Äôt a problem for us because the area was gorgeous and not crowded in the morning, so we leisurely strolled around!
