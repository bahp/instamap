I Tried a 3-Pound Mogami Wagyu Yakiniku Steak in Japan! 🍖✨

At @coconemaru_ginza in Ginza, they serve premium Mogami beef from Yamagata—cut fresh from the block. The staff helps you cook this massive sirloin steak that covers most of the grill! 😳

I enjoyed every bite and even had leftovers to take home! It was so rich and melted in my mouth.

The best part? The fat isn’t greasy like other Wagyu beef, so no food coma the next day🥹
