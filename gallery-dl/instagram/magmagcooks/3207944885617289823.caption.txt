This place was said to have inspired Miyazaki’s famous film, Spirited Away 🏮

As huge fans of the anime, we had to make a trip to Jiufen in Taiwan. The glowing lanterns and light rain made the setting feel magical. It really felt like we were in Spirited Away (including pigging out on all the good food 🐷).

Save this for your travel bucket list! 

[Edit: Miyazaki denied that this was the inspiration for the film, but Jiufen’s setting still makes it a popular destination for fans. Dogo Onsen is another location that is said to have been an inspiration.]
