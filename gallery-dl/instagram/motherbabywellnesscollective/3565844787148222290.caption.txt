If your pre-crawling baby LOVES to be put in a standing position, it may be due to tension in their body. More on this in another post. As much as they love it, resist the urge to continuously put them in standing. Instead, go back to developmental foundations during play. Here are some ideas:

‚ö™Ô∏è On their back, place a folded blanket under the pelvis to make it easier for them to engage their deep abdominals. Tap their feet together above their belly, kiss their feet, place fun socks on to encourage reaching to take them off, encourage reaching and grabbing the feet‚Ä¶we want to see more *deep core work* for our standing lovers!

‚ö™Ô∏è Go back to side-lying play! Cross that top leg over and place the foot on the floor. If they are 5+ months, let them prop up on that lower forearm to ‚Äústrike a pose‚Äù.

‚ö™Ô∏è Roll, baby, roll! Practice rolling‚Ä¶a LOT! Back to belly and belly to back. Make it playful‚Ä¶roll them consecutively 3-4 times to the right. Then reverse and roll 3-4 back to the left.

‚ö™Ô∏è Tummy time! Quality over quantity. Try a wedge like the @tumtum_usa, a @boppycompany pillow, or your lap to do a plank with support under the chest while weight-bearing on their hands. While on the floor, practice pivoting in a circle on their belly (to both sides!).

‚ö™Ô∏èSitting! Work on sitting on the floor if they are 5+ months, in side-sitting if they are 7+ months, and in your lap with feet flat on the floor if they are 7+ months (keep toys low with this one, though, as it may promote moving to standing).

‚ö™Ô∏è Kneeling play! If they are 7+ months, bring a firm couch cushion to the floor. Position them on their knees with their hands weight-bearing on the cushion. Play with toys on the cushion to encourage kneeling.
