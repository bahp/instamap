The Nozawa Onsen (Nagano prefecture) stamp trail highlights many of the famous places and historic sites in Nozawa. There are 27 stamps or commemorative plaques placed around the village and you will get a feel for the history of Nozawa onsen while you try to find them all. Pick up a stamp book from the Tourist information centre and start your adventure around the village with your book in hand. Take a rubbing from the plaques using the small wooden pestle attached to the stands. You start by laying the 2 sheets (one yellow, one white) on top of the plaque that matches the page number, and rubbing until the impression appears. If you find more than 10 you will receive a Nozawa Onsen “yu” towel- with the famous “yu” design by Artist Taro Okamoto. I would like to add that if you are a beginner for Hot Springs, the Nozawa hotsprings tend to be very hot as they are managed by locals and sometimes you need to adjust the water temperature yourself which can be a bit tricky #stamp #japan #nozawaonsen #野沢温泉 #stamping #japantravel #onsen #japaneseculture #japaneseonsen #ekistamp #traveldiary #nagano #nagano_japan #naganoprefecture
