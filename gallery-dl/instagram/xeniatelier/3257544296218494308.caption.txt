Since I started to share my experience about my life in Japanese countryside & after my twin sister @annaktina posted a video of us stamping around in Japan, we got so many questions where exactly to find them.
so here's a list of places where you can find them. I will share more secret stamp spots from now on 💮 ⛩️🫶🏻
1) train stations, at the main entrances. Not all the lines have them but most do! check the JR & Odakyu lines! 
2) airport - HANEDA at the information desk at 2nd & 3rd floor ✈️ 
3) Ryokans & hotels - always ask at the lobby 🏠 
4) hot springs - many onsen towns have a stamp rally, I posted a reel yesterday about an onsen town with 27 (!) stamps ♨️
5) souvenir shops- if you see a stamp on the packaging, means they have a stamp :) 🎁 
6) museums : most museums in Japan have their own stamps - The National Museum has 3 different stamping stations where you can stamp your own postcard which @annaktina showed in her last reel ⛩️🫶🏻
7) national parks in Tokyo have very unique stamps
8 ) BONUS : the last one is in the Shinjuku Tourist Information Center - the stamp is representing the 7 Lucky Gods ⛩️🩵 also, as I am a huge stamp collector I would find them in the most unusual places. I made a reel how I found one in a totally unexpected place by chance.
 From that moment on, I understood they can be everywhere you just need to watch out for them:)
 and once you get into it, you start finding them everywhere.
