✨ A monastery. A volcanic lake. And a hidden library with over 260,000 books.
📍 Tucked away in the German countryside, Maria Laach Abbey feels like something out of a forgotten novel.
Most people never find this place. They pass it on the highway, unaware of the stories waiting inside.

Founded in 1093, this Benedictine monastery still holds space for silence, study and soul. The library isn’t just old, it’s alive.
⛪ Wooden shelves, medieval manuscripts and a quiet so deep it feels sacred.

📌 Save this spot for your next literary pilgrimage.
