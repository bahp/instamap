Two Hours from Calgary - The Icefields Parkway üèîÔ∏è 

This is said to be one of the most scenic highways in the world. This stretch of road connects Banff NP and Jasper NP over 230km. The drive reveals a new view throughout every turn, with towering mountain peaks, ancient glaciers, and blue lakes to stop and stretch your legs. 

Here are three stops I recommend. 

Bow Lake - Right off the highway is this blue alpine lake you can enjoy from the shores or take a canoe and paddle in. 

Mistaya Canyon - A short hike to see the blue water rush through a deep canyon. 

Columbia Icefield - Take a glacier tour and stand on a 10,000-year-old sheet of ice.

There is next to no service on this highway. I recommend downloading your maps for offline use before heading out.
