Just a backpack, dried fish snacks, and the open road. 🚲🇯🇵✨ 
 
Edit:  I’ve been getting a lot of questions about this trip so I made a full guide/itinerary - link in my bio! Includes tips, tips, budget, Google maps pins, transport info, and more. Super detailed, but still designed so that you can choose your own adventure. 🚴‍♀️💫

THE SHIMANAMI KAIDO gives you the best of what traveling in Japan has to offer: epic nature, culture, elite food/hospitality, adorable animal encounters, and a choose-your-own-adventure style of exploration. 

EPIC SIDEQUESTS: admire the architecture of each suspension bridge, pay respects at the breathtaking Kosanji Temple, eat desserts in a lemon-themed town called Setoda 🍋, see sculptures and art on Ikuchi Island, visit a whole LOTTA shrines and castles, Yoshiumi Rose Garden, Kirosan Observatory Park (📸 bird’s eye view of biggest bridge), Ōkunoshima rabbit/nuclear waste island (a short ferry detour away) + MANY MORE ACTIVITY SO FUN 🎏
