Nestled in the forest, far away from the busy streets of Chiang Mai, lies Wat Pha Lat.

It was originally used as a resting place for people walking up to worship at Doi Suthep.

Wat Pha Lat is one of Chiang Mai “forest temples” located in Doi Suthep National Park, with more  than 500 years history.

In my opinion the most beautiful temple in Chiang Mai.
