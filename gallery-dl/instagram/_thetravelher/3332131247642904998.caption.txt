I bet you didn’t know these beautiful islands exist in Malaysia…

Semporna Islands, Borneo ✨

I see a lot of places in Asia on my fyp all the time, but I never see Borneo and I don’t know why, because it is so STUNNING, especially these islands! 

Each island has its own individual name, but all islands are only accessible via boat from Semporna. These islands include:
📍Boheydulang Island
📍Mabul Island
📍Mantanuan Island
📍Sibuan Island

If you’re planning a trip to Borneo, I put in my highlights which tours I did to see these beautiful islands 💙. We also stayed at Opine Villa’s (only on Airbnb) and it was also so stunnnning, highly recommend ✨

So if you’re looking for some beachy holiday inspo visit Borneo! You will not be disappointed 🥹
