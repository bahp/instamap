The worlds first book town 📚

The town of Hay-on-Wye in Wales is easily one of my favourite places in the world! It’s a place completely dedicated to books and has 26 bookshops but only 2000 residents! That’s one bookshop per 77 people! How truly magical is that?

The bookshops there are also some of the most beautiful I’ve seen- from outdoor bookshops in the castle grounds to ones decorated on the inside with interiors from a Transylvanian church! 

Not only is it heaven for all book lovers but it’s also surrounded by the beautiful Welsh countryside and has the river Wye running through it where you can go boating along the river 🛶 It’s also home to a castle that’s over 1000 years old 🏰
