Introducing our newest campervan, Sassenach. She's a beautifully rustic and homely campervan that has been professionally converted into an absolutely incredible rolling home.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Her hand-crafted interior is made from oak and cherry whiskey barrels, and the charming and super stylish vibe is completed with William Morris fabrics and Mediterranean kitchen tiles.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Being inside Sassenach is like travelling in a cosy country home where every item has been carefully and lovingly selected. This beautiful campervan also has running hot water, gas central heating, two fan roof vents as well as a huge solar panel which is perfect for an off-grid adventure.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You will find lots of internal storage space for clothes, food, gadgets and gizmos as well as a large space under the rear fixed-bed for hiking boots, rucksacks, table and chairs, and anything else you want to take along on your epic road trip that you’ll definitely be having in the gorgeous Sassenach!
