Have you ever heard of the Cammino di San Nilo?

Probably not — and that’s what makes it so special.

This multi-day hike runs for 111 km, divided into 6 or 8 legs (depends on your training), starting on the beach in Sapri and ending on the beach in Palinuro in Campania. Along the way, you cross Cilento National Park — the second largest in Italy, exploding with biodiversity, hidden trails, and landscapes that change at every turn.

But the magic lies also in the villages you pass: tiny little towns where the food is simply incredible and the hospitality of locals makes you feel like family. 

Every leg is a journey through both nature and culture.

The path follows the footsteps of San Nilo, a 10th-century monk and pilgrim who founded monasteries and became a symbol of simplicity and resilience. Like on the Camino de Santiago, here you can also collect a pilgrim credential to mark your journey.

Another plus? It’s easy to reach by fast train, making it accessible even for a short escape. And unlike many trails, this one is perfect outside the hot summer months — ideal in winter, spring, or autumn, when the air is crisp and the views are crystal clear.

This is not just a hike. It’s an immersion in history, nature, and soul.

Let me know if you end up going.

Catch You Outside,
