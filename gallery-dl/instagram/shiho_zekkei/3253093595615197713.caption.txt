海を望む天空の鳥居⛩️ Torii in the sky overlooking the sea.

天草でいちばん楽しみにしていたのが #倉岳神社 。天草諸島でいちばん高い標高682mの倉岳山頂にある神社で、航海安全を祈願して祀られているそう。

眼下に広がる八代海、そして360°広がるパノラマの景色は圧巻！海風が強いからか鳥居と祠があるのみなんだけど、漁に出る人たちを見守れる場所に建っているのだなぁと、行ってみて感じました。

今回は観光タクシーで行ったんだけど、山道がかなーり細いので運転する場合はご注意を⚠️

The place I was most looking forward to visiting in #Amakusa was #KuratakeShrine . This shrine is located on top of 682-meter-high Mt. Kuratake, the highest point in the Amakusa Islands, and is dedicated to prayers for safe voyages.

The panoramic view of the Yatsushiro Sea spreading out below and the 360° panorama is breathtaking! The shrine has only a torii gate and because of the strong sea winds, but when I visited the shrine, I felt that it was built in a place where people who go out to fish can be watched over. This time I took a sightseeing cab, but be careful when driving because the mountain road is quite narrow.
