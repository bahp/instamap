    "description": "🗻 Fuji Views: Kawaguchi Asama Shrine 😶\nKnown as the torii in the sky, this part of Kawaguchi Asama Shrine provides a stunning view of Mount Fuji and the surrounding town with a nice torii in front! ⛩️ You can get it from multiple angles. Here are four of them! Which one do you like best?\n\nAround Japan, you’ll find a lot of shrines named “Asama Jinja,” which are dedicated to Mt. Fuji and were built for the appeasement and worship of volcanoes. 🌋 While Kawaguchi Asama Shrine has been around since an eruption in 864, this torii in the sky (天空の鳥居) was built in 2019. The shrine collects ¥500 from visitors who want to use a non-phone camera to take pictures or videos here. Interestingly, it’s an annual pass, so you can pay the fee and come back again in the same year. It might be fun to go during different seasons! 🍂 It’s a good spot to add to a Tokyo day trip to the town of Fujikawaguchiko, Lake Kawaguchi, and the surrounding area.\n\n⛩️ Save this for your next day trip from Tokyo!\n\n📍Tenkuu no Torii, Kawaguchi Asama Jinja, Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi\n🚃 Kawaguchiko Station\n\n#mtfuji #japantravel #travelgram #kawaguchiko #lifeinjapan #yamanashi\n.\nJapan travel | Japan itinerary | Yamanashi travel | Japan | shrine | Mount Fuji | Tokyo day trip",
