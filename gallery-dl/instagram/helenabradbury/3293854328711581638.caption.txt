Alternative to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest 🎋

Just 20 minutes walk from Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is Adashino Nenbutsuji. This temple was absolutely stunning to visit in Autumn but it also has a Bamboo walkway.

Although it's much shorter than the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, we were there around 11am during peak autumn and there was NO ONE else there 🤯
