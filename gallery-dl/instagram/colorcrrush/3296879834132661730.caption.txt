Best of Japan in 14 days 🗺️ This itinerary is somewhat fast-paced, if you prefer to travel slower then consider staying longer at some of these destinations! I did this itinerary in spring, but I had 21 days so I added 5 days in Shikoku and stayed longer in Okayama.

I always get asked about 14 day itineraries but I find them so hard as I want to keep them diverse but also make sense in terms of travel times / not going back and forth too much. With this itinerary I feel like you get many must-sees as well as less traveled places such as Uji ☺️

If you're wondering "Where's Osaka?" I have personal beef with Osaka 💀
