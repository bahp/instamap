Let's get off the beaten path ❤️ Overtourism is a problem in Japan that is very condensed, mainly in the areas of Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. If you go even just a bit outside of the popular places, you are rewarded by beautiful scenery that you'll have mostly to yourself. 

Don't know where to go? Here are some places that I absolutely enjoyed in the busy seasons 🫶👇👇

Locations:

Magome-juku, Gifu
