Have you ever heard of Magome-juku? 
Ignored by most guidebooks and considered too far off the beaten track, Magome-juku has been perfectly reserved as an authentic Edo period (1603-1867) town to give visitors a glimpse into pre-modern Japan.

Due to its location on top of a steep hill, it is the least visited out of the historic post towns of the Nakasendo. As you can see, I basically had this whole town to myself on a beautiful afternoon. It was by far my favorite out of all the post towns that I visited! 

The cobblestone streets are lined with old, lattice-windowed residential houses, museums, tea houses, and souvenir shops on both sides, a scene that very much resembles how the post town looked in the Edo period hundreds of years ago.
