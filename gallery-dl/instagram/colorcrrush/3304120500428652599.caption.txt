My favourite castle in Japan 🏯🥹

Matsumoto is home to one of Nagano's most striking and historic sites, Matsumoto Castle! Due to its black exterior, it is also nicknamed the Crow Castle 🐦‍⬛ 

Visiting the castle park is free, for a small fee you can enter the castle's inner grounds.  I highly recommend you do so! As a major of Japanese Studies, visiting the original interior and climbing the incredibly steep stairs was a dream come true and you learn so much about the history of this castle. The view from the top floor observation platform across the city to the Northern Alps is absolutely stunning.

I made Matsumoto my base exploring Nagano Prefecture and I highly recommend it. The city is super walkable with picturesque streets, craft shops and restaurants as well as great connections via express bus and train to Nagoya, Takayama, Nagano, Kamikochi as well as ski resorts.

📍How to get to Matsumoto:
Take the limited express Azusa from Shinjuku Station for a direct and convenient connection
