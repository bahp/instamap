Best traditional villages to visit this autumn in Japan 🛖🍁 

Autumn in Japan is by far my favourite time to travel, with the summer temperatures  slowly fading, less rain and more stable weather than spring and the landscapes across the country being completely transformed.

One of my favorite places to witness the changes of the season are traditional villages in Japan. A lot of them have stunning foliage and the combination of old architecture and the wood always gives me a nostalgic feeling 💕

Iyashi no Sato (Mt Fuji) 🍁 mid through late November
Magome-juku (Gifu) 🍁 end of October - middle of November 
Ouchi-juku (Fukushima) 🍁 middle - end of October 
Shirakawago (Gifu) 🍁 mid through late October 
Narai-juku (Nagano) 🍁 end of October through middle of November 

Please note that due to the hot summer, it is currently estimated that foliage could occur later than previous years
