1015 steps ðŸ˜µ How long did you think it took me? ðŸ¤­ 

Yamadera is a cluster of temples hewn into a steep mountainside overlooking a quaint village of the same name. This was one of my favorite things to do in Yamagata Prefecture! ðŸ¥¹ðŸ©·

Not only is the ascend stunning with it's changing scenery and temples nestled into the mountains, the village of Yamadera is so worth visiting as well. I had some great good here as well as friendly chats with the locals. 

I highly recommend to start early (I arrived at 8am when the gates open) as it definitely got way more crowded around 11-12am. The cool air will also make the ascend much easier!

Would you climb all the way to the top to Yamadera? ðŸ¤­
