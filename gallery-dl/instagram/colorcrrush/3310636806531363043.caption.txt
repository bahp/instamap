Have you heard of the Venice of Japan? Only 15mins away from Okayama by train, you can find this incredibly well preserved town with its picturesque canals: Kurashiki üõ∂ 

Once an important rice distribution town during the Edo Period, today the traditional warehouses have been tranformed into caf√©s, museum, galleries, shops and restaurants. In the Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, you can find unique local specialties in terms of cuisine as well as handicraft while strolling along the canals.

We arrived pretty late in Kurashiki which gifted us with no crowds and a stunning sunset among the backdrop of the traditional houses ü•π No longer a hidden gem, Kurashiki gets pretty crowded most days. If you are not interested in visiting the museums, you should visit on a Monday for fewer crowds, as the museums are closed on that day.

üìç You can reach Kurashiki from Okayama in 15mins by local train. It's also possible to do this as a day trip from Osaka, Kyoto or Hiroshima! Make sure you arrive at JR Kurashiki Station and not the Shin-Kurashiki Station -which is 9km away from the town center.
