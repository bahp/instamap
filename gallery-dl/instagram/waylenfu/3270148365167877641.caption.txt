Destinations outside of Tokyo: Kyushu Edition

Reel Recap 2023 #1 (@ 1.6M views)

And finally the video that did it all this year! I actually really loved exploring Kyushu. There was definitely a lot of driving involed but the scenery was absolutely stunning once you got there! There are way more areas in Kyushu to explore and will definitely go back in the future ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
