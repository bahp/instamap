This is Italy’s oldest city, and one of the oldest in the world! 🇮🇹

Traces of life date back to over 9000 BC and it was founded as a city in 251 BC 🏛️

Built directly into the rock, it contains numerous secret passages and tunnels that lead to the various houses and streets.

You can visit it from Bari, Puglia, which is the nearest airport, taking just under an hour by car ✈️
