Anzeige • Probably one of the most breathtaking trails in the Brenta Dolomites @visitpaganella 🥾…

📍This is Trail No. 340 … from Molveno up to Rifugio Croz dell’Altissimo and it feels like something out of a dream 🤩

You’re walking right along dramatic cliffs, with the Brenta Dolomites towering in front of you and autumn colors glowing all around. 🍁 

It’s one of those hikes where you just keep stopping … not because you’re tired, but because the view is too good to move on 😲😲😲
