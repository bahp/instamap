The Bohol guide you need to SAVE ⤹

📍#bohol #philippines 🇵🇭

🛵 DON’T GET AROUND BY TOURS, rent a scooter instead! The island is very big and you have the freedom to explore at your own pace without overpaying touristy tours

🗓️ Stay 5+ days so you can cover Bohol (the most AMAZING nature) and Panglao (Clear beaches and great Island Hopping)

⛰️ Visit the beautiful chocolate hills - former coral reefs a million years ago that are now HUGE GREEN hills

🐒 You can visit the Tarsier Sanctuary - they are the SMALLEST PRIMATE on earth! HOWEVER it felt VERY touristy it’s ₱ 150 (~2,5€pp) for 15 minute walk with a guide that shows us 3 tarsiers

💦 Best Waterfalls: Ingkumhan Falls; Busay Falls; Kawasan Falls; Mag-Aso Falls; Can-umantad Falls

🏞️ Paddle in Loboc River and enjoy the river lunch cruise - come early, it can get pretty crowded!

🏖️ Leave Alona beach for the crowds and enjoy yourself in Dumaluan or Momo beach instead (thanks us later😉)

🪸 Best place for free dive and snorkeling🥁 Napaling Reef

🏝️Island Hopping from Panglao: Balicasag and Virgin Island with reef snorkeling and dolphins watching; Pamilacan Island (More remote and perfect for snorkeling) and Cabilao Island for divers
