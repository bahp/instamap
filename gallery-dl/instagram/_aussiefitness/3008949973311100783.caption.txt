If cooking the chicken with the exact method I have in the video bake it in the oven at 220 Degrees Celsius for 20 - 25 Minutes.
OR
To keep it simple you can just cook it regularly on a pan, in the oven, air fryer etc. 

IMPORTANT NOTES 👇🏼
- You can either cook the chicken on a pan, grill, in the oven, air fryer or whichever way you prefer & is easiest. The method I did was placing 2 wooden skewers on a half cut onion then stacking the chicken on top.
- Depending on the brand of yoghurt different ones contain more/ less moisture which can cause the dough to be sticky. If this happens slowly add more flour until you have a consistent you can work with.
- When rolling the dough out make sure to lightly flour your surface beforehand to avoid sticking.
- You don’t have to make the flatbread & can use any store bought one if you like but fresh is always best!
