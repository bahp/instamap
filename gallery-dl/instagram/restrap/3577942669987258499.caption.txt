Alec Brunson has just got back from the Atlas Mountain Race. We loved his illustration of his set up - including some Restrap bags and what he kept in them, we had to reshare it. ⁠

There's so much detail in there, and it really shows how much you can pack into an average set up. If you like the illustration, check out @brunse_draws for more bike doodling. ✏️⁠
