[ 30 K ]
We did it! 
I still can’t believe that I have reached this step in my life! It feels like it was just yesterday when I was fighting to reach the 10K mark! I can’t believe how far we have come!
I have you all to thank for allowing me to reach this objective and for being here every time to support me and motivate me! If it wasn’t for you all I wouldn’t be here celebrating this day! This is not my victory, this is our victory as a team, and as a family! This is not just a number, this is a community, a family, and a bunch of friends!
When I decided to start this path, I made it my objective to never lose myself no matter how far I would go. So today I stand here the same as I was when I had less than 10k, forever grateful and thankful and blessed for each one of you, that decided to join me in this journey through my travels and my photos!
Thank you for all the love and support really! I will give my all to always be there to share that love back with you all! Thank you for making my 2019 dream come true! There are no words that can express my gratitude towards you all! Really.. thank you..
