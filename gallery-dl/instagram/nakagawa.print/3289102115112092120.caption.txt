広島城　広島市中区
広島城は、安土桃山時代に毛利輝元が築城し天正19年(1591年)から慶長5年(1600年)の9年間初代の城主となりました。2代目は福島正則で慶長5年(1600年)から元和5年(1619年)の9年間勤めました。3代目は浅野長晟で元和5年(1619年)から寛永9年(1632年)までの13年間勤め以後は明治4年（1871年）廃城となるまでおよそ250年間浅野家が歴代の城主を勤めました。
今週は日本各地で大雪となりましたが広島市内もうっすら雪化粧となりました。
Hiroshima Castle was built by Terumoto Mori during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, and was the first lord of the castle for nine years from 1591 to 1600.The second generation was Masanori Fukushima, who ruled the castle from 1600. He served for nine years in 1619. The third generation, Nagaaki Asano, served for 13 years from 1619 to 1632, and the Asano family remained the lords of the castle for approximately 250 years until the castle was abandoned in 1871. I worked at.
Heavy snow fell in various parts of Japan. Hiroshima was also covered in a light layer of snow.
