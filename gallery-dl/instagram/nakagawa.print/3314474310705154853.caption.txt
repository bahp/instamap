厳島神社　広島県廿日市市宮島町
厳島神社は、「三つ盛り二重亀甲に剣花菱」の神紋で、北方守護の玄武（亀と蛇）を意味する亀甲紋の中に剣花菱が使われています。剣花菱の中は鏡で花びらは勾玉と剣を表し三種の神器を意味しそれを三つ重ねたもです。厳島神社は「宗像三女神」か祭神であり「三つ盛り」になっとも言われています。昔から島全体が神として崇められてきた神聖な宮島に鎮座する厳島神社の悠久の歴史を感じます。
Itsukushima Shrine has a divine crest of ``three-layered double tortoiseshell with a sword and flower bishi'', and the sword and flowerbishi are used in the turtleshell crest, which means Genbu (turtle and snake), the guardians of the north. The inside of the sword flower rhombus is a mirror, and the petals represent a magatama and a sword, meaning the three sacred treasures, and the three are stacked on top of each other. Itsukushima Shrine is said to be dedicated to the ``Three Goddesses of Munakata'' or ``Three Goddess.'' You can feel the eternal history of Itsukushima Shrine, which is located on sacred Miyajima, where the entire island has been worshiped as a god since ancient times.
