20-day itinerary 👇thru-hike the length of Switzerland 🇨🇭 Via Alpina 1 | 400 KM

Trek along the Via Alpina 1 for almost 400 kilometers from east to west, right through the Swiss Alps. The trail, which gains over 1000 meters in altitude every day, is a true physical and mental challenge 🤩

But if you accept the challenge, you will be rewarded with trail magic along the mighty four-thousanders of the Bernese Oberland, beautiful alpine mountain lakes, alpine meadows, and high mountain huts offering Swiss panoramas at every stage. At the end of the day, you can relax with a cheese fondue or mountain meal in the cozy mountain huts or other accommodations along the Via Alpina in the small typical Swiss mountain towns 🙏
