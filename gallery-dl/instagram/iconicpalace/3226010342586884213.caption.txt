Orava Castle, a historical gem, graces the landscape of Oravsk√Ω Podz√°mok, Slovakia. Its roots reach back to the 13th century, initially constructed as a wooden fortress and evolving over the centuries into the architectural marvel we see today, blending elements of Gothic, Renaissance, and Romanesque styles. Perched high on a rock above the Orava River, the castle offers captivating views of the Tatra Mountains and the scenic Orava region. Inside, visitors can explore its diverse rooms, from the Knight's Hall to the chapel and underground cellars, with the castle serving as a museum showcasing its rich history and its role in Slovak heritage. Orava Castle is not only a cultural treasure but also a famous film location, having starred in the classic vampire movie "Nosferatu" in 1922. With its rich history, cultural events, and accessibility by car, the castle remains a must-visit destination for those eager to delve into Slovakia's past and bask in its natural beauty.
