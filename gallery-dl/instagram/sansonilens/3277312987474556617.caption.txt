The 10th highest peak in England is truly a sight to behold. 

The scenery from this dramatic peak can easily compete with views from some of the finest Scottish Munro peaks. 

See these humble Wainwrights really can pack a punch. I have said it for many years, that i truly believe there is no greater view in England & The Lake District than that of Great Gable. 

That view down to Wast Water is simply unmatched, though the nearby Fleetwith Pike does give it a good running for its money. 

Do you agree, or can you think of a better English view to rival this one? Let us all know in the comments ðŸ‘‡
