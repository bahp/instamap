🇮🇹 8 Spots in Florence Only Locals Know About 

Escape the crowds and see the Florence that locals love.

1. 📍Giardino delle Rose (Rose Garden)
🌹 Hidden just below Piazzale Michelangelo, this peaceful garden has city views, sculptures by Folon, and way fewer tourists than the terrace above.

2. 📍Caffè degli Artigiani (Piazza della Passera)
☕ A tiny square in the Oltrarno where locals gather for morning coffee or an early evening spritz. Quiet, charming, and surrounded by artisan shops.

3. 📍Via dell’Amore (San Niccolò)
🚶‍♀️ A romantic little street climbing up toward San Miniato. Almost no tourists, just ivy-covered walls, stone paths, and hidden doors.

4. 📍Villa Bardini Gardens
🌿 Everyone goes to Boboli, but locals prefer Bardini. It is cheaper, calmer, and offers one of the best postcard views of Florence—especially during wisteria season.

5. 📍Trattoria La Casalinga (Oltrarno)
🍝 No-frills, family-run, and full of locals. The food is traditional Tuscan, the prices are fair, and it is been a Florentine favorite for decades.

6. 📍Drogheria (Via dei Serragli)
🍷 A cozy wine bar that blends aperitivo culture with natural wines and intimate vibes. Loved by locals, often overlooked by tourists.

7. 📍Lungarno della Zecca Vecchia
🌅 Walk east along the Arno past the crowds to find peaceful riverbanks, where locals jog, read, or watch the sunset without selfie sticks.

8. 📍Brancacci Chapel (Santa Maria del Carmine)
🎨 Home to Masaccio’s Renaissance frescoes that even inspired Michelangelo—but most people have never heard of it. No lines, just art and awe.
