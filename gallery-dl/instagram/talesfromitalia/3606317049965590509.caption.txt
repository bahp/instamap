🇮🇹10 Hidden Gems in Tuscany That Tourists Miss 🌻🇮🇹

1. Bagno Vignoni – A Thermal Village Frozen in Time ♨️
A tiny village with a hot spring in the main square. Quiet, magical, and totally unique. Perfect for a slow morning and a soak.

2. Sovana – Etruscan Magic & Stone Streets
Think ancient necropolises, zero crowds, and a medieval square that feels untouched. History + peace = yes please.

3. Montefioralle – Tiny Tuscan Hilltop Fairytale
Right next to Greve in Chianti, this village is tiny but insanely beautiful. Cobblestone alleys, flower-filled windows, and barely any tourists.

4. Murlo – A Hidden Hamlet with Etruscan Roots
It’s small, walled, and feels like stepping back centuries. No crowds, just pure Tuscan silence and beauty.

5. Castiglione d’Orcia – Overlooked, But Oh So Scenic
This Val d’Orcia village has panoramic views, a medieval tower you can climb, and barely any foot traffic.

6. San Quirico d’Orcia – The Photo Spot No One Talks About 📸
Rolling hills, cypress-lined roads, and charming streets. The perfect base for exploring Tuscany without the tour buses.

7. Cetona – A Peaceful Local Vibe in Southern Tuscany
Quaint piazzas, beautiful walks, and a true “local-only” feel. Great for foodies and slow travelers.

8. Abbey of San Galgano – A Roofless Church with a Legend ⛪
Looks like a movie set. This Gothic abbey has no roof and a magical sword-in-the-stone nearby (literally). Off the beaten path and unforgettable.

9. Certaldo Alto – Medieval Streets & Sunset Views 🌇
Take the funicular up and explore this walled hill town. It’s got history, views, and a cozy charm that rivals San Gimignano—without the crowds.

10. Poppi – A Castle Town in the Casentino Hills 🏰
