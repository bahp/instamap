One of the most beautiful summer festival I’ve ever seen in Japan😍😍 

The Noshiro Tenku no Fuyajo Council’s “Tanabata Festival - Lantern Castles in the Sky” is a mesmerizing annual event held in Noshiro, Akita Prefecture.

Since 2008, this festival has enchanted visitors with its spectacular display of large, intricately designed lanterns resembling traditional Japanese castles floating in the night sky. Celebrated as part of the Tanabata Festival, it honors the legendary meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi. 

This is not considered a big scale festival so there were more locals than tourists during the festival and it wasn’t too crowded so it’s easy to get beautiful photos and footages😍 they also opened up time for everyone to get closer to the lantern castles to shoot! 

Held every year during August 2nd-3rd

能代七夕天空の不夜城😍😍這個祭典真的太壯觀太美了！
感覺彷彿來到另一個世界！而且聽名字就覺得很美？🤣不夜城欸！

這裡真的是因為諸多原因一直沒有辦法來，有點遠之外，這裡夏天很容易因為洪水所以電車停駛🥲還好這次是自駕來就沒有太多交通上的擔心！

這個祭典不算是非常大型的祭典所以人也沒有想像中的多！遊客也比較少，中途可以近距離跟超級壯觀的燈籠城堡拍照😍還有燈籠可以借！覺得觀賞體感超級好！👍不怕太遠的人很推薦可以去看看 燈籠真的非常壯觀！

每年舉辦時間： 8/2-8/3
