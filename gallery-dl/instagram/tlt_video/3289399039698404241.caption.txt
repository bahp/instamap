This restaurant is located not far from Namba Station.
It is usually loved by business people as a cool down after work.
Above all, the friendliness of the waitstaff and the counter tables that are easy to enter even for one person are impressive.
The high quality items at unpretentious prices are an irresistible urge for the hungry.
There is no bgm, but the sounds of cooking and unleashed business people chatting and laughing warm the restaurant.😜😜😜
I highly recommend it for its great atmosphere.
