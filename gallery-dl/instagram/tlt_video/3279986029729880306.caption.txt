There are many hidden gems in the back alleys of Kobe.
When I think of yakitori, this restaurant comes to mind.
The most important thing is that there are many regular customers who have been coming here for more than 20 years, but first-time customers are also satisfied with the food.
The reason for this is the exquisitely compact counter seating and high ceilings.

On the menu, the chicken is grilled to perfection over Kishu-binchotan charcoal, using chicken imported from the Awaji and Tamba regions, which is harvested in the morning.
The freshness of the meat is evident when you take a bite, and we hope you will experience it for yourself.

The manager can speak both English and Japanese, so you can rest assured that you are in good hands.
Why don't you include this restaurant in your Kobe course?
