Places in London every Londoner should go to at least once ♥️🇬🇧 part 1

📚 Daunt Books in Marylebone, my absolute favourite bookshop in London.
💰 The Royal Exchange in Bank, a beautiful historical building where you can also enjoy afternoon tea (not open on weekends).
💘 The Millennium Bridge at sunset.
🫖 The Savoy for afternoon tea, a must experience in my opinion for a special occasion.
🖼️ The Wallace Collection in Marylebone, a little known free museum where you can find exceptional paintings, sculpture, ceramics, furniture and arms and armour, gifted to Britain in 1900.
🏙️ The Lookout at 8 Bishopsgate, for beautiful panoramic views over the city.
🧖 AIRE Ancient Baths, the most beautiful spa in London in my opinion.
🍸 The American Bar at the Stafford Hotel, a cosy bar that makes the most scenic and creative cocktails.
🍃 The NoMad for a cosy weekend brunch in Covent Garden.
