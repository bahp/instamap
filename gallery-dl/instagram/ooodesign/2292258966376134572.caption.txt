Everything we design is built in-house by our experienced team in our south London workshop.

The images show our most recent conversion. Everything was cut by hand, hand sanded and hand finished using natural oil. We used birch plywood for the furniture elements and pine cladding for the walls which we white washed. The electricity is solar powered and it has a gas powered cooker with hob. The dining area doubles as extra bed space by sliding the table into bed frame. Big thanks to the team for smashing this one and excited for the next!
