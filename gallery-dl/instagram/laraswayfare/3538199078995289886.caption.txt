3 WEEK ITINERARY for NORWAY 🇳🇴🏔️🌿

You start this itinerary in Bodø in the North of Norway. The best time is in the summer months. Plan at least three weeks for this route!

📌 Steigen
The area around Steigen is located north of Bodø and you should definitely visit it before taking the ferry from Bodø to Moskenes (Lofoten). It’s a lot less touristy here, but no less beautiful. Definitely visit Bøsanden beach!

📌 Lofoten
You arrive in the very south of Lofoten, in Moskenes (Ferry Harbor). You can now spend the next few days exploring the Lofoten Islands. These are my favorite places: Reine & Reinebringen Hike, Kvalvika Beach & Ryten Hike, Hauklandstranda & Mannen Hike, Henningsvær, Delpen Hike. If you are planning to explore the area by campervan, please refrain from wild camping out of consideration for nature and the locals!

📌 Andøya
The island of Andøya is located to the north of Lofoten. It’s definitely worth making a little detour here! There is a great campsite on the beautiful kilometer-long beach of Bleik and you can book a trip to the island of Bleiksøya to see the puffins! The hike to Matinden is also highly recommended.

📌 Senja 
Take the ferry from Andenes to Gryllefjord to get to Senja. (Please note: the ferry only operates in the summer months!) 
On Senja, visit the beautiful viewpoint Tungeneset, as well as the beach Ersfjord and hike to Hesten with a great view of Segla!

📌 Nordkapp
From Senja, it’s still a relatively long way to Nordkapp, the northernmost point on the European mainland. It’s worth stopping in the city of Tromsø on the way. The further north you drive, the higher your chances of encountering free-roaming reindeer!
