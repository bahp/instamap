Did you know that there is a town in France that inspired Hayao Miyazaki’s animated film, Howl’s Moving Castle?

That place is Colmar. A quaint and charming town in the Alsace region of France, Colmar is one of our favorite day trips from Paris, being only 2 and a half hours away. It literally looks like a place out of a fairytale. 

If you’re looking to explore other places outside of Paris or a fan of Studio Ghibli films, this is a place you have to add to your list!
