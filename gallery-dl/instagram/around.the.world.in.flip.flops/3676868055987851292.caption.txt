Don't take the bullet train between Kyoto and Osaka 🚫 There's a much better option 👇🏼

The distance between Kyoto and Osaka isn't long but some people still choose to take the bullet trains between those cities. I get that people wanna do it for the experience of riding a bullet train but hear me out because there's an even better (and cheaper) experience 😍

🚃 KYO-TRAIN GARAKU!
🎍 What makes this train so special is the historical interior and the 2 japanese gardens it has inside of it
